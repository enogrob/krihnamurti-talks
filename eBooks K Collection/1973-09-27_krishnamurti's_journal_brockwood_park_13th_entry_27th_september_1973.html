It had become a sanctuary for birds and monkeys, parrots and doves.  Some of the headless statues were still massive in their beauty; they had a still dignity. The whole place was surprisingly clean and one could sit on the ground to watch the monkeys and chattering birds.  Once very long ago, the temple must have been a flourishing place with thousands of worshippers, with garlands, incense and prayer.  Their atmosphere was still there, their hopes, fears and their reverence.  The holy sanctuary was gone long ago.  Now the monkeys disappeared as it was growing hot but the parrots and doves had their nests in the holes and crevices of the high walls.  This old ruined temple was too far away for the villagers to further destroy it.  Had they come they would have desecrated the emptiness.

Religion has become superstition and image-worship, belief and ritual.  It has lost the beauty of truth; incense has taken the place of reality.  Instead of direct perception there is in its place the image carved by the hand or the mind.  The only concern of religion is the total transformation of man.  And all the circus that goes on around it is nonsense.  That's why the truth is not to be found in any temple, church or mosque, however beautiful they are.  Beauty of truth and the beauty of stone are two different I things.  One opens the door to the immeasurable and the other to, the imprisonment of man; the one to freedom and the other to the bondage of thought. Romanticism and sentimentality deny the very nature of religion, nor is it a plaything of the intellect.  Knowledge in the area of action is necessary to function efficiently and objectively, but knowledge is not the means of the transformation of man; knowledge is the structure of thought and thought is the dull repetition of the known, however modified and enlarged.  There is no freedom through the ways of thought, the known. The long snake lay very still along the dry ridge of the rice fields, lusciously green and bright in the morning sun.  Probably it was resting or waiting for some careless frog.  Frogs were being shipped then to Europe to be eaten as a delicacy.  The snake was long and yellowish; and very still; it was almost the colour of the dry earth, hard to see but the light of day was in its dark eyes.  The only thing that was moving, in and out, was its black tongue.  It could not have been aware of the watcher who was somewhat behind its head.  Death was everywhere that morning.  You could you could hear it in the village; the great sobs as the body, wrapped in a cloth was being carried out; a kite was streaking down on a bird; some animal was being killed; you heard its agonizing cries.  So it went on day after day: death is always everywhere, as sorrow is.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The beauty of truth and its subtleties are not in belief and dogma, they never are where man can find them for there is no path to its beauty; it is not a fixed point, a haven of shelter.  It has its own tenderness whose love is not to be measured nor can you hold it, experience it.  It has no market value to be used and put aside.It is there when the mind and heart are empty of the things of thought. The monk or the poor man are not near it, nor the rich; neither the intellectual nor the gifted can touch it.  The one who says he knows has never come near it.  Be far away from the world and yet live it.

The parrots were screeching and fluttering around the Tamarind tree that morning; they begin early their restless activity, with their coming and going.  They were bright streaks of green with strong, red, curved beaks.  They never seemed to fly straight but always zig-zagging, shrieking as they flew.  occasionally they would come to sit on the parapet of the verandah; then you could watch them, but not for long; they would be off again with their crazy and noisy flight.  Their only enemy seemed to be man.  He puts them in a cage. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
