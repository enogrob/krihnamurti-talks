<FONT size=5 color=black><B>LETTERS TO SCHOOLS VOLUME ONE 15TH SEPTEMBER, 1979</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>One is apt to forget or disregard the responsibility of the educator to bring about a new generation of human beings who are psychologically, inwardly free of miseries, anxieties and travail. It is a sacred responsibility, not to be easily set aside for one's own ambitions,status or power.  If the educator feels such a responsibility - the greatness of it and the depth and beauty of that responsibility - he will find the capacity to instruct and to sustain his own energy.  This demands great diligence, not a periodic, haphazard endeavour, and the very profound responsibility will kindle the fire that will maintain him as a total human being and a great teacher.  As the world is rapidly degenerating, there must be in all these schools a group of teachers and students who are dedicated to bringing about a radical transformation of human beings through right education.  The word right is not a matter of opinion, evaluation or some concept invented by the intellect.  The word right denotes total action in which all self-interested motive ceases.  The very dominant responsibility, the concern not only of the educator but also of the student, banishes self-perpetuating problems.  However immature the mind, once you accept this responsibility that very acceptance brings about the flowering of the mind.This flowering is in the relationship between the student and the educator.  It is not a one-sided affair. When you read this, please give your total attention and feel the urgency and intensity of this responsibility.  Please do not make it into an abstraction, an idea, but rather observe the actual fact, the actual happening in the reading of this.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Almost all human beings in their lives desire power and wealth. When there is wealth there is a sense of freedom, and pleasure is pursued.  The desire for power seems be an instinct which expresses itself in many ways.  It is in the priest, the guru, the husband or the wife, or in one boy over another.  This desire to dominate or to submit is one of the conditions of man, probably inherited from the animal.This aggressiveness and the yielding to it pervert all relationships throughout life.  This has been the pattern from the beginning of time.  Man has accepted this as a natural way of life, with all the conflicts and miseries it brings.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Basically measurement is involved in it - the more and the less, the greater and the smaller - which is essentially comparison.  One is always comparing oneself with another, comparing one painting with another; there is comparison between the greater power and the lesser, between the timid and the aggressive.  It begins almost at birth and continues throughout life - this constant measurement of power, position, wealth.  This is encouraged in schools, colleges and universities.  Their whole system of gradation is this comparative value of knowledge.  When A is compared to B, who is clever, bright, assertive, that very comparison destroys A.  This destruction takes the form of competition, of imitation and conformity to the patterns set by B.  This breeds, consciously or unconsciously, antagonism, jealousy, anxiety and even fear; and this becomes the condition in which A lives for the rest of his life, always measuring, always comparing psychologically and physically.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This comparison is one of the many aspects of violence.  The word "more" is always comparative, as is the word "better".  The question is, can the educator put aside all comparison, all measurement, in his teaching?  Can he take the student as he is, not as what he should be, not make judgements based on comparative evaluations?  It is only when there is comparison between the one called clever and the one called dull that there is such a quality as dullness. The idiot - is he an idiot because of comparison or because he is incapable of certain activities?  We set certain standards which are based on measurement and those who do not come up to them are considered deficient.  When the educator puts aside comparison and measurement, then he is concerned with the student as he is and his relationship with the student is direct and totally different.  This is really very important to understand.  Love is not comparative.  It has no measurement.  Comparison and measurement are ways of the intellect.  This is divisive.  When this is basically understood,not the verbal meaning but the actual truth of it - the relationship of teacher and student undergoes a radical change.  The ultimate tests of measurement are the examinations with their fear and anxieties which deeply affect the future life of the student.  The whole atmosphere of a school undergoes a change when there is no sense of competition, comparison. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
