<FONT size=5 color=black><B>COMMENTARIES ON LIVING SERIES I CHAPTER 16 'SLEEP'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>IT WAS A cold winter and the trees were bare, their naked branches exposed to the sky.  There were very few evergreen trees, and even they felt the cold winds and the frosty nights.  In the far distance the high mountains were covered with heavy snow, and white billowy clouds hung over them.  The grass was brown, for there had been no rain for many months, and the spring rains were still distant.  The earth was dormant and fallow.  There was no cheery movement of nesting birds in green hedges, and the paths were hard and dusty.  On the lake there were a few ducks, pausing on their way to the south.  The mountains held the promise of a new spring, and the earth was dreaming of it.

What would happen if sleep were denied to us?  Would we have more time to fight, to intrigue, to make mischief?  Would we be more cruel and ruthless?  Would there be more time for humility, compassion and frugality?  Would we be more creative?  Sleep is a strange thing, but extraordinarily important.  For most people, the activities of the day continue through their nocturnal slumbers; their sleep is the continuation of their life, dull or exciting, an extension at a different level of the same insipidity or meaningless strife.  The body is refreshed by sleep; the internal organism, having a life of its own, renews itself. During sleep, desires are quiescent, and so do not interfere with the organism; and with the body refreshed, the activities of desire have further opportunities for stimulation and expansion.  Obviously, the less one interferes with the internal organism, the better; the less the mind takes charge of the organism, the more healthy and natural is its function.  But disease of the organism is another matter, produced by the mind or by its own weakness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sleep is of great significance.  The more the desires are strengthened, the less the meaning of sleep.  Desires, positive or negative, are fundamentally always positive, and sleep is the temporary suspension of this positive.  Sleep is not the opposite of desire, sleep is not negation, but a state which desire cannot penetrate.  The quietening of the superficial layers of consciousness takes place during sleep, and so they are capable of receiving the intimations of the deeper layers; but this is only a partial comprehension of the whole problem.  It is obviously possible for all the layers of consciousness to be in communication with each other during waking hours, and also during sleep; and of course this is essential.  This communication frees the mind from its own self-importance, and so the mind does not become the dominant factor. Thus it loses, freely and naturally, its self-enclosing efforts and activities.  In this process the impetus to become is completely dissolved, the accumulative momentum exists no longer.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But there is something more that takes place in sleep.  There is found an answer to our problems.  When the conscious mind is quiet, it is capable of receiving an answer, which is a simple affair.  But what is far more significant and important than all this is the renewal which is not a cultivation.  One can deliberately cultivate a gift, a capacity, or develop a technique, a pattern of action and behaviour; but this is not renewal.  Cultivation is not creation. This creative renewal does not take place if there is any kind of effort on the part of a becomer.  The mind must voluntarily lose all accumulative impulse, the storing up of experience as a means to further experience and achievement.  It is the accumulative, self-protective urge that breeds the curve of time and prevents creative renewal. Consciousness as we know it is of time, it is a process of recording and storing experience at its different levels.  Whatever takes place within this consciousness is its own projection; it has its own quality, and is measurable.  During sleep, either this consciousness is strengthened, or something wholly different takes place.  For most of us, sleep strengthens experience, it is a process of recording and storing in which there is expansion but not renewal. Expansiveness gives a feeling of elation, of inclusive achievement, of having understood, and so on; but all this is not creative renewal.  This process of becoming must wholly come to an end, not as a means to further experience, but as an ending in itself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During sleep, and often during waking hours, when becoming has entirely ceased, when the effect of a cause has come to an end, then that which is beyond time, beyond the measure of cause and effect, comes into being.
