<FONT size=5 color=black><B>WASHINGTON D.C. TALKS 1985 FOREWORD BY MARY ZIMBALIST</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>In spite of his many years of giving public talks in the United States, Krishnamurti had not spoken in Washington, D.C.  When he agreed to do so in April 1985, it was in a sense to a new audience, one to which in the compression of only two talks he wished to convey as much of his teaching as possible.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On both days the hall was filled with a varied, seriously-interested audience and as Krishnamurti spoke there seemed an intangible response, a quality in which the listeners joined in his communication.  Krishnamurti felt it and although there were to be other talks before his death ten months later, on those two days in April 1985, at the age of ninety, Krishnamurti spoke from the summit of his life and teaching.
