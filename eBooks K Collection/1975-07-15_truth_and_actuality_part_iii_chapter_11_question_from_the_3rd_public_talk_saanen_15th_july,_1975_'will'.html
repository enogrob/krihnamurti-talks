<FONT size=5 color=black><B>TRUTH AND ACTUALITY PART III CHAPTER 11 QUESTION FROM THE 3RD PUBLIC TALK SAANEN 15TH JULY, 1975 'WILL'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>Questioner: I wish to know if effort of will has a place in life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Krishnamurti: Has the will a place in life?  What do we mean by life? - going to the office every day, having a profession, a career, the everlasting climbing the ladder, both religiously and mundanely, the fears, the agonies, the things that we have treasured, remembered, all that is life, isn't it?  All that is life, both the conscious as well as the hidden.  The conscious of which we know, more or less; and all the deep down hidden things in the cave of one's mind, in the deepest recesses of one's mind.  All that is life: the illusion and the reality, the highest principle and the "what is", the fear of death, fear of living, fear of relationship - all that.  What place has will in that?  That is the question.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I say it has no place.  Don't accept what I am saying; I am not your authority, I am not your guru.  All the content of one's consciousness, which is consciousness, is created by thought which is desire and image.  And that is what has brought about such havoc in the world.  Is there a way of living in this world without the action of will?  That is the present question.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I know this, as a human being I am fully aware of what is going on within my consciousness, the confusion, the disorder, the chaos, the battle, the seeking for power, position, safety, security, prominence, all that; and I see thought has created all that. Thought plus desire and the multiplication of images.  And I say, "What place has will in this?" It is will that has created this.  Now can I live in this without will? Biologically, physiologically, I have to exercise a certain form of energy to lean a language, to do this and that.  There must be a certain drive.  I see all this.  And I realise - not as a verbal realization, as a description, but the, actual fact of it, as one realizes pain in the body - I realize that this is the product of thought as desire and will.  Can I, as a human being, look at aU this, and transform this without will?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now what becomes important is what kind of observation is necessary.  Observation to see actually what is.  Is the mind capable of seeing actually "what is"?  Or does it always translate into "what should be", "what should not be", "I must suppress", "I must not suppress", and all the rest of it?  There must be freedom to observe, otherwise I can't see.  If I am prejudiced against you, or like you, I can't see you.  So freedom is absolutely necessary to observe - freedom from prejudice, from information, from what has been learned, to be able to look without the idea.  You understand: to look without the idea.  As we said the other day, the word "idea" comes from Greek; the root meaning of that word is to observe, to see.  When we refuse to see, we make an abstraction and make it into an idea.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There must be freedom to observe, and in that freedom will is not necessary; there is just freedom to look.  Which means, to put it differently, if one makes a statement, can you listen to it without making it into an abstraction?  Do you understand my question?  The speaker makes a statement such as, "The ending of sorrow is the beginning of wisdom".  Can you listen to that statement without making an abstraction of it? - the abstraction being: "Is that possible?", "What do we get from it?,', "How do we do it?".  Those are all abstractions - and not actually listening.  So can you listen to that statement with all your senses, which means with all your attention?  Then you see the truth of it.  And the perception of that truth is action in this chaos. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
