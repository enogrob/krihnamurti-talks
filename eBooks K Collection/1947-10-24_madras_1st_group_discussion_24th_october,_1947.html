<FONT size=5 color=black><B>MADRAS 1ST GROUP DISCUSSION 24TH OCTOBER, 1947</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>Before we begin to discuss, I would like to say something about the discussion and its purpose.  First of all, it is not a club for disputation and argumentation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In Europe and in America, we had groups of different types of people and we went into things that we thought were very important;  we continued such clubs for a couple of months or even sometimes longer.  At the end of it, some did understand.  Similarly, I hope that during these months or weeks of discussion we will get somewhere.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I feel that each one of us must discover or prepare the field so that Reality comes into being;  because, Reality is the only solution of our problems whether economic, social, religious, or of relationship between ourselves.  Without the realisation of that, I do not see how any problem in the world can be solved.  My intention in holding these discussions is to help each other to realize it.  It is going to be very arduous because it requires real revolution in thinking, in all the phases of our life.  I feel that it is a matter of life and death.  Therefore, before we begin to discuss, we must know our various intentions, that is, the relationship between yourself and myself, I may want to go north and you may want to go south;  we may eventually meet because south and north do meet as the earth is round.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We are going to discover what our intentions are during these discussions.  So, please bear in mind the importance of relationship between ourselves so that we may both go to the same direction not compulsorily but naturally, spontaneously.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Before we begin to discuss anything, we ought to know our intention, what it is that we want, or what it is that we are unconsciously, deeply, seeking.  If we can find that, our problems become comparatively simple.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another point in discussion is that I will use words which have meaning to me but not to you.  I am using words very carefully because they have a meaning to me, and I use very simple and straight language which I am willing to explain carefully. I do not know if you have ever thought about this.  Words have the verbal meaning as well as the nervous response.  Take, for example, the word God. It has a verbal as well as a nervous response.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These discussions should not deteriorate into mere argumentation, nor should we indulge in verbal expression.  We want to discuss together so that we can see something which is beyond words, beyond emotional, sentimental or intellectual froth.  And that can only be done if each one of us is willing to expose himself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These discussions should give an opportunity to understand ourselves. As it is not questioning and answering, do not put questions and wait for my answer.  We travel together on a journey.  I may perhaps know a little more than you do.  You are also travelling on that road.  You do not have to sit on the roadside and know little of the journey.  We are making the same journey and discovering together.  It is like unfolding a map and seeing the various places and proceeding on the right path.  Then, this is a mutual discovery.  If we are willing to undertake the journey together, it will be a process of self-discovery and self-understanding, from which we begin to think rightly and, therefore, act rightly. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
