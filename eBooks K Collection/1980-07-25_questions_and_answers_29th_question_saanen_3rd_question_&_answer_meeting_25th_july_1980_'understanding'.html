<FONT size=5 color=black><B>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 29TH QUESTION SAANEN 3RD QUESTION & ANSWER MEETING 25TH JULY 1980 'UNDERSTANDING'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>Question: I have understood the things we have talked over during these meetings, even if only intellectually.  I feel they are true in a deep sense.  Now when I go back to my country shall I talk about your teachings with friends?  Or since I am still a fragmented human being will I only produce more confusion and mischief by talking about them?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All the religious preachings of the priests, the gurus, are promulgated by fragmented human beings.  Though they say, "We are high up", they are still fragmented human beings.  And the questioner says: I have understood what you have said somewhat, partially, not completely; I am not a transformed human being.  I understand, and I want to tell others what I have understood.  I do not say I have understood the whole, I have understood a part.  I know it is fragmented, I know it is not complete, I am not interpreting the teachings, I am just informing you what I have understood.  Well, what is wrong with that?  But if you say: "I have grasped the whole completely and I am telling you" - then you become an authority, the interpreter; such a person is a danger, he corrupts other people. But if I have seen something which is true I am not deceived by it; it is true and in that there is a certain affection, love, compassion; I feel that very strongly - then naturally I cannot help but go out to others; it would be silly to say I will not.  But I warn my friends, I say, "Look, be careful, do not put me on a pedestal".  The speaker is not on a pedestal.  This pedestal, this platform, is only for convenience; it does not give him any authority whatever.  But as the world is, human beings are tied to something or other - to a belief, to a person, to an idea, to an illusion, to a dogma - so they are corrupt; and the corrupt speak and we, being also somewhat corrupt, join the crowd.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Seeing the beauty of these hills, the river, the extraordinary tranquillity of a fresh morning, the shape of the mountains, the valleys, the shadow how everything is in proportion, seeing all that, will you not write to your friend, saying, "Come over here, look at this?" You are not concerned about yourself but only about the beauty of the mountain. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
