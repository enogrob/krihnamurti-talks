<FONT size=5 color=black><B>KRISHNAMURTI'S JOURNAL BROCKWOOD PARK 11TH ENTRY 24TH SEPTEMBER 1973</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>A new consciousness and a totally new morality are necessary to bring about a radical change in the present culture and social structure.  This is obvious, yet the left and the right and the revolutionary seem to disregard it.  Any dogma, any formula, any ideology, is part of the old consciousness; they are the fabrications of thought whose activity is fragmentation the left, the right, the centre.  This activity will inevitably lead to bloodshed of the right or of the left or to totalitarianism.  This is what is going on around us.  One sees the necessity of social, economic and moral change but the response is from the old consciousness thought being the principle actor.  The mess, the confusion and the misery that human beings have got into within the area of the old consciousness, and without changing that profoundly, every human activity, political, economic and religious, will only bring us to the destruction of each other and the earth.  This is so obvious to the sane.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One has to be a light to oneself; this light is the law.  There is no other law.  All the other laws are made by thought and so fragmentary and contradictory.  To be a light to oneself is not to follow the light of another, however reasonable, logic, historical, and however convincing.  You cannot be a light to yourself if you are in the dark shadows of authority, of dogma, of conclusion.  Morality is not put together by thought; it is not the outcome of environmental pressure, it is not of yesterday, of tradition. Morality is the child of love and love is not desire and pleasure. Sexual or sensory enjoyment is not love.

High in the mountains there were hardly any birds, there were some crows, there were deer and an occasional bear.  The huge redwoods, the silent ones, were everywhere, dwarfing all the other trees.  It was a magnificent country and utterly peaceful, for no hunting was allowed.  Every animal,every tree and flower was protected.  Sitting under one of those massive redwoods, one was aware of the history of man and the beauty of earth.  A fat red squirrel passed by most elegantly, stopping a few feet away, watching and wondering what you were doing there.  The earth was dry, though there was a stream nearby.  Not a leaf stirred and the beauty of silence was among the trees.  Going slowly along the narrow path, round the bend was a bear with four cubs as large as big cats.  They rushed off to climb up trees and the mother faced one without a movement, without a sound.  About fifty feet separated us; she was enormous, brown, and prepared.  One immediately turned one's back on her and left.  Each understood that there was no fear and no intention to hurt, but all the same one was glad to be among the protecting trees, squirrels and the scolding jays.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Freedom is to be a light to oneself; then it is not an abstraction, a thing conjured by thought.  Actual freedom is freedom from dependency, attachment, from the craving for experience. Freedom from the very structure of thought is to be a light to oneself.  In this light all action takes place and thus it is never contradictory.  Contradiction exists only when that law, light, is separate from action, when the actor is separate from action.  The ideal, the principle, is the barren movement of thought and cannot co-exist with this light; one denies the other.  This light, this law, is separate from you; where the observer is, this light, this love, is not.  The structure of the observer is put together by thought, which is never new, never free.  There is no "how", no system, no practice.  There is only the seeing which is the doing. You have to see, not through the eyes of another.  This light, this law, is neither yours nor that of another.  There is only light. This is love. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
