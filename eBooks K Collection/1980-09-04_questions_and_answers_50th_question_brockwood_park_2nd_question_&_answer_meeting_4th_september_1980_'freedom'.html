<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Many philosophers have written about freedom.  We talk of freedom - freedom to do what we like, to have any job we like, freedom to choose a woman or a man, freedom to read any book, or freedom not to read at all.  We are free, and what do we do with that freedom?  We use that freedom to express ourselves, to do whatever we like.  More and more life is becoming permissive - you can have sex in the open park or garden.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We have every kind of freedom and what have we done with it.  We think that where there is choice we have freedom.  I can go to Italy or France: a choice.  But does choice give freedom?  Why do we have to choose?  If you are very clear, perceive purely, there is no choice.  Out of that comes right action.  It is only when there is doubt and uncertainty that we begin to choose.  So choice, if you will forgive my saying so, prevents freedom.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The totalitarian states have no freedom at all, because they have the idea that freedom brings about the degeneration of man. Therefore they control, suppress - you know what is happening.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So what is freedom?  Is it based on choice?  Is it to do exactly what we like?  Some psychologists say, if you feel something, do not suppress, restrain or control it, but express it immediately.  And we are doing that very well, too well.  And this is also called freedom. Is throwing bombs freedom? - just look what we have reduced our freedom to!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Does freedom lie out there, or here?  Where do you begin to search for freedom?  In the outward world, where you express whatever you like, the so-called individual freedom, or does freedom begin inwardly, which then expresses itself intelligently outwardly?  You understand my question?  freedom exists only when there is no confusion inside me, when I am psychologically and religiously not to be caught in any trap - you understand?  There are innumerable traps: gurus, saviours, preachers, excellent books, psychologists and psychiatrists; they are all traps.  And if I am confused and there is disorder, must I not first be free of that disorder before I talk of freedom?  If I have no relationship with my wife, my husband or another - because our relationships are based on images - there is conflict which is inevitable where there is division.  So should I not begin here, inside me, in my mind, in my heart, to be totally free of all fears, anxieties, despairs and the hurts and wounds that one has received through some psychic disorder?  Watch all that for oneself and be free of it!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But apparently we have not the energy.  We go to another to give us energy.  By talking to a psychiatrist we feel relieved - confession and all the rest of it.  Always depending on somebody else.  And that dependence inevitably brings conflict and disorder. So one has to begin to understand the depth and the greatness of freedom; one must begin with that which is nearest, oneself.  The greatness of freedom, real freedom, the dignity, the beauty of it, is in oneself when there is complete order.  And that order comes only when we are a light to ourselves. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
