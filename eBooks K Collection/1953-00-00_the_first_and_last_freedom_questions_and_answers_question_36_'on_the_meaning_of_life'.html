<FONT size=5 color=black><B>THE FIRST AND LAST FREEDOM QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS QUESTION 36 'ON THE MEANING OF LIFE'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>Question: We live but we do not know why.  To so many of us, life seems to have no meaning.  Can you tell us the meaning and purpose of our living?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Krishnamurti: Now why do you ask this question?  Why are you asking me to tell you the meaning of life, the purpose of life?  What do we mean by life?  Does life have a meaning, a purpose?  Is not living in itself its own purpose, its own meaning?  Why do we want more?  Because we are so dissatisfied with our life, our life is so empty, so tawdry, so monotonous, doing the same thing over and over again, we want something more, something beyond that which we are doing.  Since our everyday life is so empty, so dull, so meaningless, so boring, so intolerably stupid, we say life must have a fuller meaning and that is why you ask this question.  Surely a man who is living richly, a man who sees things as they are and is content with what he has, is not confused; he is clear, therefore he does not ask what is the purpose of life.  For him the very living is the beginning and the end.  Our difficulty is that, since our life is empty, we want to find a purpose to life and strive for it.  Such a purpose of life can only be mere intellection, without any reality; when the purpose of life is pursued by a stupid, dull mind, by an empty heart, that purpose will also be empty.  Therefore our purpose is how to make our life rich, not with money and all the rest of it but inwardly rich - which is not something cryptic.  When you say that the purpose of life is to be happy, the purpose of life is to find God, surely that desire to find God is an escape from life and your God is merely a thing that is known.  You can only make your way towards an object which you know; if you build a staircase to the thing that you call God, surely that is not God.  Reality can be understood only in living, not in escape.  When you seek a purpose of life, you are really escaping and not understanding what life is. Life is relationship, life is action in relationship; when I do not understand relationship, or when relationship is confused, then I seek a fuller meaning.  Why are our lives so empty?  Why are we so lonely, frustrated?  Because we have never looked into ourselves and understood ourselves.  We never admit to ourselves that this life is all we know and that it should therefore be understood fully and completely.  We prefer to run away from ourselves and that is why we seek the purpose of life away from relationship.  If we begin to understand action, which is our relationship with people, with property, with beliefs and ideas, then we will find that relationship itself brings its own reward.  You do not have to seek.  It is like seeking love.  Can you find love by seeking it?  Love cannot be cultivated.  You will find love only in relationship, not outside relationship, and it is because we have no love that we want a purpose of life.  When there is love, which is its own eternity, then there is no search for God, because love is God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is because our minds are full of technicalities and superstitious mutterings that our lives are so empty and that is why we seek a purpose beyond ourselves.  To find life's purpose we must go through the door of ourselves; consciously or unconsciously we avoid facing things as they are in themselves and so we want God to open for us a door which is beyond.  This question about the purpose of life is put only by those who do not love.  Love can be found only in action, which is relationship. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
