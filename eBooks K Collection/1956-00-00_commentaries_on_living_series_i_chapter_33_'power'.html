<FONT size=5 color=black><B>COMMENTARIES ON LIVING SERIES I CHAPTER 33 'POWER'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>HE WAS A very poor man, but capable and clever; he was content, or at least appeared so, with what little he possessed, and he had no family burdens.  He often came to talk things over, and he had great dreams for the future; he was eager and enthusiastic, simple in his pleasures, and delighted in doing little things for others.  He was not, he said, greatly attracted to money or to physical comfort; but he liked to describe what he would do if he had money, how he would support this or that how he would start the perfect school, and so on.  He was rather dreamy and easily carried away by his own enthusiasm and by that of other?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Several years passed, and then one day he came again.  There was a strange transformation in him.  The dreamy look had gone; he was matter-of-fact, definite, almost brutal in his opinions, and rather harsh in his judgements.  He had travelled, and his manner was highly polished and sophisticated; he turned his charm on and off.  He had been left a lot of money and was successful in increasing it many times, and he had become an altogether changed man.  He hardly ever comes now; and when on rare occasions we do meet, he is distant and self-enclosed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Both poverty and riches are a bondage.  The consciously poor and the consciously rich are the playthings of circumstances.  Both are corruptible, for both seek that which is corrupting: power.  Power is greater than possessions; power is greater than wealth and ideas. These do give power; but they can be put away, and yet the sense of power remains.  One may beget power through simplicity of life, through virtue, through the party, through renunciation; but such means are a mere substitution and they should not deceive one.  The desire for position, prestige and power - the power that is gained through aggression and humility, through asceticism and knowledge, through exploitation and self-denial - is subtly persuasive and almost instinctive.  Such in any form is power, and failure is merely the denial of success.  To be powerful, to be successful is to be slavish, which is the denial of virtue.  Virtue gives freedom, but it is not a thing to be gained.  Any achievement, whether of the individual or of the collective, becomes a means to power.  Success in this world, and the power that self-control and self-denial bring, are to be avoided; for both distort understanding. It is the desire for success that prevents humility; and without humility how can there be understanding?  The man of success is hardened, self-enclosed; he is burdened with his own importance, with his responsibilities, achievements and memories.  There must be freedom from self-assumed responsibilities and from the burden of achievement; for that which is weighed down cannot be swift, and to understand requires a swift and pliable mind.  Mercy is denied to the successful, for they are incapable of knowing the very beauty of life which is love.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The desire for success is the desire for domination.  To dominate is to possess, and possession is the way of isolation.  This self-isolation is what most of us seek, through name, through relationship, through work, through ideation.  In isolation there is power, but power breeds antagonism and pain; for isolation is the outcome of fear, and fear puts an end to all communion.  Communion is relationship; and however pleasurable or painful relationship may be, in it there is the possibility of self-forgetfulness.  Isolation is the way of the self, and all activity of the self brings conflict and sorrow. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
