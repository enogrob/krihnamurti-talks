<FONT size=5 color=black><B>KRISHNAMURTI'S JOURNAL BROCKWOOD PARK 24TH ENTRY 10TH OCTOBER 1973</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>The rains had come and gone and the huge boulders were glistening in the morning sun.  There was water in the dry riverbeds and the land was rejoicing once again; the earth was redder and every bush and blade of grass was greener and the deep-rooted trees were putting out new leaves.  The cattle were getting fatter and the villagers less thin.  These hills are as old as the earth and the huge boulders appear to have been carefully balanced there.  There is a hill towards the east that has the shape of a great platform on which a square temple has been constructed.  The village children walked several miles to learn to read and write; here was one small child, all by herself, with shining face, going to a school in the next village, a book in one hand and some food in the other.  She stopped as we went by, shy and inquisitive; if she stayed longer she would be late for her school.  The rice fields were startlingly green.  It was a long, peaceful morning.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two crows were squabbling in the air, cawing and tearing at each other; there was not enough foothold in the air, so they came down to the earth, struggling with each other.  On the ground feathers began to fly and the fight began to be serious.  Suddenly about a dozen other crows descended upon them and put an end to their fight.  After a lot of cawing and scolding they all disappeared into the trees.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Violence is everywhere, among the highly educated and the most primitive, among the intellectuals and the sentimentalists.  Neither education nor organized religions have been able to tame man; on the contrary, they have been responsible for wars, tortures, concentration camps and for the slaughter of animals on land and sea. The more he progresses the more cruel man seems to become.  Politics have become gangsterism, one group against another; nationalism has led to war; there are economic wars; there are personal hatreds and violence.  Man doesn't seem to learn from experience and knowledge, and violence in every form goes on.  What place has knowledge in the transformation of man and his society?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The energy that has gone into the accumulation of knowledge has not changed man; it has not put an end to violence.  The energy that has gone into a thousand explanations of why he's so aggressive, brutal, insensitive, has not put an end to his cruelty The energy which has been spent in analysis of the causes of his insane destruction, his pleasure in violence, sadism, the bullying activity, has in no way made man considerate and gentle.  In spite of all the words and books, threats and punishments, man continues his violence.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Violence is not only in the killing, in the bomb, in revolutionary change through bloodshed; it is deeper and more subtle. Conformity and imitation are the indications of violence; imposition and the accepting of authority are an indication of violence; ambition and competition are an expression of this aggression and cruelty, and comparison breeds envy with its animosity and hatred. Where there's conflict, inner or outer, there is the ground for violence.  Division in all its forms brings about conflict and pain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You know all this; you have read about the actions of violence, you have seen it in yourself and around you and you have heard it, and yet violence has not come to an end.  Why?  The explanations and the causes of such behaviour have no real significance.  If you are indulging in them, you are wasting your energy which you need to transcend violence.  You need all your energy to meet and go beyond the energy that is being wasted in violence.  Controlling violence is another form of violence, for the controller is the controlled.  In total attention, the summation of all energy, violence in all its forms comes to an end.  Attention is not a word, an abstract formula of thought, but an act in daily life.  Action is not an ideology, but if action is the outcome of it then it leads to violence.

After the rains, the river goes around every boulder, every town and village and however much it is polluted, it cleanses itself and runs through valleys, gorges and meadows. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
