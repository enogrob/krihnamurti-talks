Then the mind is rested; it has brought about order within itself and that is why sleep is so important.  Either it brings about order in its relationship and action during the waking hours, which gives to the mind complete rest during sleep, or during sleep it will attempt to arrange its affairs to its own satisfaction.  During the day there will again be disorder caused by so many factors, and during the hours of sleep the mind will try to extricate itself from this confusion.  Mind, brain, can only function efficiently, objectively, where there is order.  Conflict in any form is disorder. Consider what the mind goes through every day of its life: the attempt at order in sleep and disorder during waking hours.  This is the conflict of life, day in, day out.  The brain can only function in security, not in contradiction and confusion.  So it tries to find it in some neurotic formula but the conflict becomes worse.  Order is the transformation of all this mess.  When the observer is the observed there is complete order.

In the little lane that goes by the house, shaded and quiet, a little girl was sobbing her heart out, as only children can do.  She must have been five or six, small for her age.  She was sitting on the ground, tears pouring down her cheeks.  He sat down with her and asked what had happened but she couldn't talk, sobbing took all her breath.  She must have been struck or her favourite toy broken or something which she wanted denied by a harsh word.  The mother came out, shook the child and carried her in.  She barely looked at him for they were strangers.  A few days later, walking along the same lane, the child came out of her house, full of smiles, and walked with him a little way.  The mother must have given her permission to go with a stranger.  He walked often in that shaded lane and the girl with her brother and sister would come out and greet him.  Will they ever forget their hurts and their sorrows or will they gradually build for themselves escapes and resistances?  To keep these hurts seems to be the nature of human beings and from this their actions become twisted.  Can the human mind never be hurt or wounded?  Not to be hurt is to be innocent.  If you are not hurt you will naturally not hurt another. Is this possible?  The culture in which we live does deeply wound the mind and heart.  The noise and the pollution, the aggression and competition, the violence and the education all these and more contribute to the agony.  Yet we have to live in this world of brutality and resistance: we are the world and the world is us.  What is the thing that is hurt?  The image that each one has built about himself, that is what is hurt.  Strangely these images, all over the world are the same, with some modifications.  The essence of the image you have is the same as of the man a thousand miles away.  So you are that man or woman.  Your hurts are the hurts of thousands: you are the other.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Is it possible never to be hurt?  Where there is wound there is no love.  Where there is hurt, then love is mere pleasure.  When you discover for yourself the beauty of never being hurt, then only do all the past hurts disappear.  In the full present the past has lost its burden.

He has never been hurt though many things happened to him, flattery and insult, threat and security.  It is not that he was insensitive, unaware: he had no image of himself, no conclusion, no ideology.  Image is resistance and when that is not, there is vulnerability but no hurt.  You may not seek to be vulnerable, highly sensitive, for that which is sought and found is another form of the same image.  Understand this whole movement, not merely verbally, but have an insight into it.  Be aware of the whole structure of it without any reservation.  Seeing the truth of it is the ending of the image builder.  The pond was overflowing and there were a thousand reflections on it.  It became dark and the heavens were open. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
