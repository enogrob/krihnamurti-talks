Reality being, as we said, all the things that thought has put together. Reality means, the root meaning of that word is, things or thing. And living in the world of things, which is reality, we want to establish a relationship with a world which has no things - which is impossible."

"Actuality means `What is'...  Are you facing in yourself what actually is going on..  You don't take actuality and look at it."
