You realise that it is entirely a new question and your memory does not furnish any framework of reference with which you could answer this question.  There is, therefore, hesitancy or silence on the part of the mind.  To the challenge involved in the question, what is thinking, there is no ready response from you because the question is absolutely new.  There is therefore a gap between the challenge and the corresponding response.  What is the state of mind during this gap?  In this state, the mind does not refer to any framework of reference but at the same time it is extremely alert though passive.  Therefore, intelligence comes into being; the state of a 'new' mind facing a new challenge can be known by you, though it cannot be verbalised. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
