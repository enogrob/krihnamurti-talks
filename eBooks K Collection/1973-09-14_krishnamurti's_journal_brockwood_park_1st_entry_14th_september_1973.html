<FONT size=5 color=black><B>KRISHNAMURTI'S JOURNAL BROCKWOOD PARK 1ST ENTRY 14TH SEPTEMBER 1973</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>The other day, coming back from a good walk among the fields and trees, we passed through the grove [Many rare trees, including redwoods, grow in the grove at Brockwood.] near the big white house. Coming over the stile into the grove one felt immediately a great sense of peace and stillness.  Not a thing was moving.  It seemed sacrilegious to walk through it, to tread the ground; it was profane to talk, even to breathe.  The great redwood trees were absolutely still; the American Indians call them the silent ones and now they were really silent.  Even the dog didn't chase the rabbits.  You stood still hardly daring to breathe; you felt you were an intruder, for you had been chatting and laughing, and to enter this grove not knowing what lay there was a surprise and a shock, the shock of an unexpected benediction.  The heart was beating less fast, speechless with the wonder of it.  It was the centre of this whole place.  Every time you enter it now, there's that beauty, that stillness, that strange stillness.  Come when you will and it will be there, full, rich and unnameable.

Any form of conscious meditation is not the real thing; it can never be.  Deliberate attempt to meditate is not meditation.  It must happen; it cannot be invited.  Meditation is not the play of the mind nor of desire and pleasure.  All attempt to meditate is the very denial of it.  Only be aware of what you are thinking and doing and nothing else.  The seeing, the hearing, is the doing, without reward and punishment.  The skill in doing lies in the skill of seeing, hearing.  Every form of meditation leads inevitably to deception, to illusion, for desire blinds.  It was a lovely evening and the soft light of spring covered the earth. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
