<FONT size=5 color=black><B>MADRAS 45TH GROUP DISCUSSION 17TH DECEMBER, 1947</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>Let us consider the truth or the inner significance of falling in love in relation to the understanding of what thinking is in the light of our previous action.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When you fall in love with a woman, it is a new experience to you.  To understand the truth of it you must think rightly.  First you realise how all frameworks of references imposed upon you by society (you are old, you are poor, etc), by your relations and by your friends are all hindrances; when you understand them as such, those hindrances fall away.  You are free now.  When the frameworks from outside of you fall away, intelligence has begun to operate.  You want, however, to be sure that it is whole intelligence and not partial intelligence.  When you analyse your state carefully and deeply, you find that your mind dwells upon a past occasion when you saw your love and that your mind also looks forward with the hope of meeting her at a future date - because both of these give sensuous pleasure.  All memory, personal experience, gives sensuous pleasure.  So you find that while you are in love, there is 'self-forgetfulness' or complete giving over of yourself to another;  and also there is a continuity of the self which seeks sensuous pleasure in the past or in the future.  This means that self-forgetfulness which implies the giving away even of your life for your love, is in operation with its contradiction namely 'clinging to self'.  This is really an indication of lack of intelligence.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When you think over this, you realise that society in condemning your state is hindering you at every stage in your search for Truth;  you are mis-informed and forced to adopt frameworks ever since your childhood, and none can help you to find Truth.  You then realise that you are alone and you have to be alone if you seek Truth.  In the history of the world every seeker after Truth has found himself alone as explained above.  This has been mistaken as a need to run away from the world in order to seek God, Truth. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
