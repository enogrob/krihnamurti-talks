<FONT size=5 color=black><B>COMMENTARIES ON LIVING SERIES I CHAPTER 9 'KNOWLEDGE'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>WE WERE WAITING for the train, and it was late.  The platform was dirty and noisy, the air acrid.  There were many people waiting, like us.  Children were crying, a mother was suckling her baby, the vendors were shouting their wares, tea and coffee were being sold, and it was an altogether busy and clamorous place.  We were walking up and down the platform, watching our own footsteps and the movement of life about us.  A man came up to us and began to talk in broken English.  He said he had been watching us, and felt impelled to say something to us.  With great feeling he promised he would lead a clean life, and that from this moment he would never smoke again.  He said he was not educated, as he was only a rickshaw boy.  He had strong eyes and a pleasant smile.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Presently the train came.  In the carriage a man introduced himself.  He was a well-known scholar; he knew many languages and could quote freely in them.  He was full of years and knowledge, well-to-do and ambitious.  He talked of meditation, but he gave the impression that he was not speaking from his own experience.  His god was the god of books.  His attitude towards life was traditional and conformatory; he believed in early, prearranged marriage and in a strict code of life.  He was conscious of his own caste or class and of the differences in the intellectual capacity of the castes.  He was strangely vain in his knowledge and position.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The sun was setting, and the train was passing through lovely country.  The cattle were coming home, and there was golden dust. There were huge, black clouds on the horizon, and the crack of distant thunder.  What joy a green field holds, and how pleasant is that village in the fold of a curving mountain! Darkness was setting in.  A big, blue deer was feeding in the fields; he did not even look up as the train roared by.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Knowledge is a flash of light between two darknesses; but knowledge cannot go above and beyond that darkness, Knowledge is essential to technique, as coal to the engine; but it cannot reach out into the unknown.  The unknown is not to be caught in the net of the known.  Knowledge must be set aside for the unknown to be; but how difficult that is!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We have our being in the past, our thought is founded upon the past.  The past is the known, and the response of the past is ever overshadowing the present, the unknown.  The unknown is not the future, but the present.  The future is but the past pushing its way through the uncertain present.  This gap, this interval, is filled with the intermittent light of knowledge, covering the emptiness of the present; but this emptiness holds the miracle of life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Addiction to knowledge is like any other addiction; it offers an escape from the fear of emptiness, of loneliness, of frustration, the fear of being nothing.  The light of knowledge is a delicate covering under which lies a darkness that the mind cannot penetrate.  The mind is frightened of this unknown, and so it escapes into knowledge, into theories, hopes, imagination; and this very knowledge is a hindrance to the understanding of the unknown.  To put aside knowledge is to invite fear, and to deny the mind, which is the only instrument of perception one has, is to be vulnerable to sorrow, to joy.  But it is not easy to put aside knowledge.  To be ignorant is not to be free of knowledge.  Ignorance is the lack of self-awareness; and knowledge is ignorance when there is no understanding of the ways of the self. Understanding of the self is freedom from knowledge.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There can be freedom from knowledge only when the process of gathering, the motive of-accumulation, is understood.  The desire to store up is the desire to be secure, to be certain.  This desire for certainty through identification, through condemnation and justification, is the cause of fear, which destroys all communion. When there is communion, there is no need for accumulation.  Accumulation is self-enclosing resistance, and knowledge strengthens this resistance.  The worship of knowledge is a form of idolatry, and it will not dissolve the conflict and misery of our life.  The cloak of knowledge conceals but can never liberate us from our ever increasing confusion and sorrow.  The ways of the mind do not lead to truth and its happiness.  To know is to deny the unknown. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
