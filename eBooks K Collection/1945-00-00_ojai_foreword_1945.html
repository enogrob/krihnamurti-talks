<FONT size=5 color=black><B>OJAI FOREWORD 1945</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>This book of Talks, like our previous publications, contains reports of spontaneous discourses about life and reality, given at different times, and is not intended, therefore, to be read through consecutively or hurriedly as a novel or as a systematized philosophical treatise.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These Talks were written down by me immediately after they were given and later I carefully revised them for publication.  Unfortunately, a few individuals, unasked, circulated their own notes of some of these Talks but those reports should in no way be considered authentic or correct.  To prevent misrepresentation and maintain the accuracy of these teachings we inform those who may be seriously interested that only the publications of Krishnamurti Writings, Inc., are reliable and authentic.
