<FONT size=5 color=black><B>MADRAS 33RD GROUP DISCUSSION 19TH NOVEMBER, 1947</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>We discussed yesterday the desirability of giving up greed.  So long as the mind is after the achievement of a result there is bound to be greed.  There is no question of giving up of greed.  When there is clear understanding the greed will cease.  A mind that is concerned with explanations and conclusions will not be able to see the truth of a problem.  If you begin to enquire into the cause then the mind will be led to the examination of those causes and the present state will not be understood.  Instantaneous transformation will take place only when you realise and face 'what you are'. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
