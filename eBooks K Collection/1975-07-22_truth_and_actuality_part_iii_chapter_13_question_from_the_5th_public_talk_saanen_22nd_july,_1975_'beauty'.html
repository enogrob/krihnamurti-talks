<FONT size=5 color=black><B>TRUTH AND ACTUALITY PART III CHAPTER 13 QUESTION FROM THE 5TH PUBLIC TALK SAANEN 22ND JULY, 1975 'BEAUTY'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>Is beauty in the world of reality?  Or is it not within the movement of thought as time?  Please follow this carefully because we are investigating together.  I am not laying down the law.  I am just asking myself: does beauty lie within the movement of thought as time?  That is, within the field of reality.  There are beautiful paintings, statues, sculpture, marvellous cathedrals, wonderful temples.  If you have been to India, some of those ancient temples are really quite extraordinary: they have no time, there has been no entity as a human being who put them together.  And those marvellous old sculptures from the Egyptians, from the Greeks, down to the Moderns.  That is, is it expression and creation?  Does creation need expression?  I am not saying it does, or does not, I am asking, enquiring.  Is beauty, which is both expression outwardly and the sense of inward feeling of extraordinary elation, that which comes when there is complete cessation of the "me", with all its movements?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To enquire what is beauty, we have to go into the question of what is creation.  What is the mind that is creative?  Can the mind that is fragmented, however capable, whatever its gifts, talent, is such a mind creative?  If I live a fragmented life, pursuing my cravings, my selfishness, my self-centred ambitions, pursuits, my pain, my struggle - is such a mind (I am asking) creative? - though it has produced marvellous music, marvellous literature, architecture and poetry - English and other literature is filled with it.  A mind that is not whole, can that be creative?  Or is creation only possible when there is total wholeness and therefore no fragmentation?  A mind that is fragmented is not a beautiful mind, and therefore it is not creative. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
