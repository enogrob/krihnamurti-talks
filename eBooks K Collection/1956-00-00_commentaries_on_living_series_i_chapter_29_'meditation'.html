<FONT size=5 color=black><B>COMMENTARIES ON LIVING SERIES I CHAPTER 29 'MEDITATION'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>HE HAD PRACTISED a number of years what he called meditation; he had followed certain disciplines after reading many books on the subject, and had been to a monastery of some kind where they meditated several hours a day.  He was not sentimental about it, nor was he blurred by the tears of self-sacrifice.  He said that, though after these many years his mind was under control, it still sometimes got out of control; that there was no joy in his meditation; and that the self-imposed disciplines were making him rather hard and arid. Somehow he was very dissatisfied with the whole thing.  He had belonged to several so-called religious societies, but now he had finished with them all and was seeking independently the God they all promised.  He was getting on in years and was beginning to feel rather weary.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Right meditation is essential for the purgation of the mind, for without the emptying of the mind there can be no renewal.  Mere continuity is decay.  The mind withers away by constant repetition, by the friction of wrong usage, by sensations which make it dull and weary.  The control of the mind is not important; what is important is to find out the interests of the mind.  The mind is a bundle of conflicting interests, and merely to strengthen one interest against another is what we call concentration, the process of discipline.  Discipline is the cultivation of resistance, and where there is resistance there is no understanding.  A well-disciplined mind is not a free mind, and it is only in freedom that any discovery can be made.  There must be spontaneity to uncover the movements of the self, at whatever level it may be placed.  Though there may be unpleasant discoveries, the movements of the self must be exposed and understood; but disciplines destroy the spontaneity in which discoveries are made.  Disciplines, however exacting, fix the mind in a pattern.  The mind will adjust itself to that for which it has been trained; but that to which it adjusts itself is not the real.  Disciplines are mere impositions and so can never be the means of denudation.  Through self-discipline the mind can strengthen itself in its purpose; but this purpose is self-projected and so it is not the real.  The mind creates reality in its own image, and disciplines merely give vitality to that image.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Only in discovery can there be joy - the discovery from moment to moment of the ways of the self.  The self, at whatever level it is placed, is still of the mind.  Whatever the mind can think about is of the mind.  The mind cannot think about something which is not of itself; it cannot think of the unknown.  The self at any level is the known; and though there may be layers of the self of which the superficial mind is not aware, they are revealed in the action of relationship; and when relationship is not confined within a pattern, it gives an opportunity for self-revelation.  Relationship is the action of the self, and to understand this action there must be awareness without choice; for to choose is to emphasize one interest against another.  This awareness is the experiencing of the action of the self, and in this experiencing there is neither the experiencer nor the experienced.  Thus the mind is emptied of its accumulations; there is no longer the "me," the gatherer.  The accumulations, the stored-up memories are the "me; the "me" is not an entity apart from the accumulations.  The "me" separates itself from its characteristics as the observer, the watcher, the controller, in order to safe- guard itself, to give itself continuity amidst impermanency.  The experiencing of the integral, unitary process frees the mind from its dualism.  Thus the total process of the mind, the open as well as the hidden, is experienced and understood - not piece by piece, activity by activity, but in its entirety.  Then dreams and everyday activities are ever an emptying process.  The mind must be utterly empty to receive; but the craving to be empty in order to receive is a deep-seated impediment, and this also must be understood completely, not at any particular level.  The craving to experience must wholly cease, which happens only when the experiencer is not nourishing himself on experiences and their memories.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The purgation of the mind must take place not only on its upper levels, but also in its hidden depths; and this can happen only when the naming or terming process comes to an end.  Naming only strengthens and gives continuity to the experiencer, to the desire for permanency, to the characteristic of particularizing memory. There must be silent awareness of naming, and so the understanding of it.  We name not only to communicate, but also to give continuity and substance to an experience, to revive it and to repeat its sensations.  This naming process must cease, not only on the superficial levels of the mind, but throughout its entire structure. This is an arduous task, not to be easily understood or lightly experienced; for our whole consciousness is a process of naming or terming experience, and then storing or recording it.  It is this process that gives nourishment and strength to the illusory entity, the experiencer as distinct and separate from the experience. Without thoughts there is no thinker.  Thoughts create the thinker, who isolates himself to give himself permanency; for thoughts are always impermanent.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is freedom when the entire being, the superficial as well as the hidden, is purged of the past.  Will is desire; and if there is any action of the will, any effort to be free, to denude oneself, then there can never be freedom, the total purgation of the whole being.  When all the many layers of consciousness are quiet, utterly still, only then is there the immeasurable, the bliss that is not of time, the renewal of creation. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
