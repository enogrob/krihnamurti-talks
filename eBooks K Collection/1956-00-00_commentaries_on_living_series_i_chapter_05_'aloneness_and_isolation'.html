<FONT size=5 color=black><B>COMMENTARIES ON LIVING SERIES I CHAPTER 5 'ALONENESS AND ISOLATION'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>THE SUN HAS gone down and the trees were dark and shapely against the darkening sky.  The wide, strong river was peaceful and still. The moon was just visible on the horizon: she was coming up between two great trees, but she was not yet casting shadows.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We walked up the steep bank of the river and took a path that skirted the green wheat-fields.  This path was a very ancient way; many thousands had trodden it, and it was rich in tradition and silence.  It wandered among fields and mangoes, tamarinds and deserted shrines.  There were large patches of garden, sweet peas deliciously scenting the air.  The birds were settling down for the night, and a large pond was beginning to reflect the stars.  Nature was not communicative that evening.  The trees were aloof; they had withdrawn into their silence and darkness.  A few chattering villagers passed by on their bicycles, and once again there was deep silence and that peace which comes when all things are alone.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This aloneness is not aching, fearsome loneliness.  It is the aloneness of being; it is uncorrupted, rich, complete.  That tamarind tree has no existence other than being itself.  So is the aloneness. One is alone, like the fire, like the flower, but one is not aware of its purity and of its immensity, One can truly communicate only when there is aloneness.  Being alone is not the outcome of denial, of self-enclosure.  Aloneness is the purgation of all motives, of all pursuits of desire, of all ends Aloneness is not an end product of the mind.  You cannot wish to be alone.  Such a wish is merely an escape from the pain of not being able to commune.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Loneliness, with its fear and ache, is isolation, the inevitable action of the self.  This process of isolation, whether expansive or narrow, is productive of confusion, conflict and sorrow.  Isolation can never give birth to aloneness; the one has to cease for the other to be.  Aloneness is indivisible and loneliness is separation.  That which is alone is pliable and so enduring.  Only the alone can commune with that which is causeless, the immeasurable.  To the alone, life is eternal; to the alone there is no death.  The alone can never cease to be.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The moon was just coming over the tree tops, and the shadows were thick and dark.  A dog began to bark as we passed the little village and walked back along the river.  The river was so still that it caught the stars and the lights of the long bridge among its waters. High up on the bank children were standing and laughing, and a baby was crying.  The fishermen were cleaning and coiling their nets.  A night-bird flew silently by.  Someone began to sing on the other bank of the wide river, and his words were clear and penetrating.  Again the all-pervading aloneness of life. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
