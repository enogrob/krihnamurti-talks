<FONT size=5 color=black><B>COMMENTARIES ON LIVING SERIES I CHAPTER 88 'WORK'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>ALOOF AND INCLINED to be cynical, he was some kind of minister in the Government.  He had been brought along, or more probably dragged, by a friend, and seemed rather surprised at finding himself there. The friend wanted to talk something over and evidently thought that the other might as well come along and hear his problem.  The minister was curious and rather superior.  He was a big man, sharp of eye and a facile talker.  He had arrived in life, and was settling back.  To travel is one thing, and to arrive is another.  Travelling is constant arriving, and arrival that has no further travelling is death.  How easily we are gratified, and how quickly discontent finds contentment!  We all want a refuge of some kind, a haven from all conflict, and we generally find it.  The clever, like the foolish, find their haven and are alert within it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I have been trying to understand my problem for a number of years, but I haven't been able to get to the bottom of it.  In my work I have always brought about antagonism; enmity has somehow crept in amongst all the people I have tried to help.  In helping some, I sow opposition among others.  With one hand I give, and with the other I seem to injure.  This has been going on for more years than I can remember, and now a situation has arisen in which I have to act rather decisively.  I really don't want to hurt anyone, and I am at a loss what to do."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which is more important: not to hurt, not to create enmity, or to do some piece of work?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"In the course of my work I do hurt others.  I am one of those people who throw themselves into their work; if I undertake something, I want to see it through.  I have always been that way. I think I am fairly efficient and I hate to see inefficiency. After all, if we undertake some kind of social work, we must go through with it, and those who are inefficient or slack naturally get hurt and become antagonistic.  The work of bringing help to others is important, and in helping the needy I hurt those who come in the way. But I really don't want to hurt people, and I have begun to realize that I must do something about it."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which to you is important: to work, or not to hurt people?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"When one sees so much misery and plunges into the work of reform, in the course of that work one hurts certain people, though most unwillingly."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In saving one group of people, others are destroyed.  One country survives at the expense of another.  The so-called spiritual people, in their ardour for reform, save some and destroy others; they bring blessings and also curses.  We always seem to be kind to some and brutal to others.  Why?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which to you is important: to work, or not to hurt people?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"After all, one has to hurt certain people, the slovenly, the inefficient, the selfish, it seems inevitable.  Don't you hurt people by your talks?  I know a rich man who has been very hurt by what you say about the wealthy."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I do not want to hurt anyone.  If people are hurt in the process of certain work, then to me that work has to be put aside.  I have no work, no schemes for any kind of reform or revolution.  With me work is not first, but not to hurt others.  If the rich man feels hurt by what is said, he is not hurt by me, but by the truth of what is, which he dislikes; he doesn't want to be exposed.  It is not my intention to expose another.  If a man is temporarily exposed by the truth of what is and gets angry at what he sees, he puts the blame on others; but that is only an escape from the fact.  It is foolish to be angry with a fact.  Avoidance of a fact through anger is one of the commonest and most thoughtless reactions.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But you have not answered my question.  Which to you is important: to work, or not to hurt people?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Work has to be done, don't you think?" put in the minister. Why should it be done?  If in the course of benefiting some you hurt or destroy others, what value has it?  You may save your particular country, but you exploit or maim another.  Why are you so concerned about your country, your party, your ideology?  Why are you so identified with your work?  Why does work matter so much?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"We have to work, be active, otherwise we might as well be dead. When the house is burning, we cannot for the moment be concerned with fundamental issues."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To the merely active, fundamentals are never the issue; they are only concerned with activity, which brings superficial benefits and deep harms.  But if I may ask our friend: why is a certain kind of work so important to you?  Why are you so attached to it?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Oh, I don't know, but it gives me a great deal of happiness."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So you are really not interested in the work itself, but in what you get out of it.  You may not make money at it, but you derive happiness from it.  As another gains power, position and prestige in saving his party or his country, so you gain pleasure from your work; as another finds great satisfaction, which he calls a blessing, in serving his saviour, his guru, his Master, so you are satisfied by what you call altruistic work.  Actually it is not the country, the work, or the saviour that is important to you, but what you get out of it.  Your own happiness is all-important, and your particular work gives you what you want.  You are really not interested in the people you are supposed to be helping; they are only a means to your happiness.  And obviously the inefficient, those who stand in your way, get hurt; for the work matters, the work being your happiness. This is the brutal fact, but we cunningly cover it with high-sounding words like service, country, peace, God, and so on.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, if one may point out, you really do not mind hurting people who hinder the efficiency of the work that gives you happiness.  You find happiness in certain work, and that work, whatever it be, is you.  You are interested in getting happiness, and the work offers you the means; therefore the work becomes very important, and then of course you are very efficient, ruth- less, dominating for the sake of that which gives you happiness. So you do not mind hurting people, breeding enmity.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I have never seen it that way before, and it is perfectly true. But what am I to do about it?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Is it not important to find out also why you have taken so many years to see a simple fact like this?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I suppose, as you say, I really didn't care whether I hurt people or not so long as I got my way.  I generally do get my way, because I have always been very efficient and direct - which you would call ruthlessness, and you are perfectly right.  But what am I to do now?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You have taken all these years to see this simple fact because until now you have been unwilling to see it; for in seeing it you are attacking the very foundation of your being.  You have sought happiness and found it, but it has always brought conflict and antagonism; and now, perhaps for the first time, you are facing facts about yourself.  What are you going to do?  Is there not a different approach to work?  Is it not possible to be happy and work, rather than to seek happiness in work?  When we use work or people as a means to an end, then obviously we have no relationship, no communion either with the work or with people; and then we are incapable of love.  Love is not a means to an end; it is its own eternity.  When I use you and you use me, which is generally called relationship, we are important to each other only as a means to something else; so we are not important to each other at all.  From this mutual usage, conflict and antagonism must inevitably arise.  So what are you going to do?  Let us both discover what to do rather than seek an answer from another.  If you can search it out, your finding of it will be your experiencing of it; then it will be real and not just a confirmation or conclusion, a mere verbal answer.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"What, then, is my problem?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Can we not put it this way?  Spontaneously, what is your first reaction to the question: Does the work come first?  If it does not, then what does?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I am beginning to see what you are trying to get at.  My first response is shock; I am really appalled to see what I have been doing in my work for so many years.  This is the first time I have faced the fact of what is, as you call it, and I assure you it is not very pleasant.  If I can go beyond it, perhaps I shall see what is important, and then the work will naturally follow.  But whether the work or something else comes first is still not clear to me."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why is it not clear?  Is clarity a matter of time, or of willingness to see?  Will the desire not to see disappear by itself in the course of time?  Is not your lack of clarity due to the simple fact that you don't want to be clear because it would upset the whole pattern of your daily life?  If you are aware that you are deliberately postponing, are you not immediately clear?  It is this avoidance that brings confusion.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"It is all becoming very clear to me now, and what I shall do is immaterial.  Probably I shall do what I have been doing, but with quite a different spirit.  We shall see." </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
