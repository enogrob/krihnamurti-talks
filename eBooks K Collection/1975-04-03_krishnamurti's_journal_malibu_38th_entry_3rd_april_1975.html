<FONT size=5 color=black><B>KRISHNAMURTI'S JOURNAL MALIBU 38TH ENTRY 3RD APRIL 1975</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>How extraordinarily beautiful is the great curve of a wide river. You must see it from a certain height, not too far up or too close as it meanders lazily through the green fields.  The river was wide, full of water, blue and clear.  We were not flying at a great altitude and we could just see the strong current in the middle of the river with its tiny waves; we followed it, past towns and villages to the sea.  Each curve had its own beauty, its own strength, its own movement.  And far away were the great snowcovered peaks, pink in the early morning light; they covered the eastern horizon.  The wide river and those great mountains seemed to hold, for that hour, eternity - this overwhelming sense of timeless space. Though the plane was rushing south-east, in that space there was no direction, no movement, only that which is.  For a whole hour there was nothing else, not even the noise of the jets.  Only when the Captain announced that we would soon be landing did that full hour come to an end.  There was no memory of that hour, no record of the content of that hour and so thought had no hold on it.  When it came to an end there were no remains, the slate was clean again.  So thought had no means to cultivate that hour and so it got ready to leave the plane.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What thought thinks about is made into a reality but it's not the truth.  Beauty can never be the expression of thought.  A bird is not made by thought and so it's beautiful.  Love is not shaped by thought and when it is it becomes something quite different.  The worship of the intellect and its integrity is a reality made by thought.  But it is not compassion.  Thought cannot manufacture compassion; it can make it into a reality, a necessity, but it will not be compassion. Thought by its very nature is fragmentary and so it lives in a fragmented world of division and conflict.  So knowledge is fragmentary and however much it is piled up, layer after layer, it will still remain fragmented, broken up.  Thought can put together a thing called integration and that too will be a fragment. The very word science means knowledge, and man hopes through science he will be transformed into a sane and happy human being. And so man is pursuing eagerly knowledge of all the things of the earth and of himself.  Knowledge is not compassion and without compassion knowledge breeds mischief and untold misery and chaos. Knowledge cannot make man love; it can create war and the instruments of destruction but cannot bring love to the heart or peace to the mind.  To perceive all this is to act, not an action based on memory or patterns.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Love is not memory, a remembrance of pleasures. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
