<FONT size=5 color=black><B>KRISHNAMURTI'S JOURNAL ROME 35TH ENTRY 29TH OCTOBER 1973</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>In the valley of orange orchards, this one was very well looked after row upon row of young trees, strong and sparkling in the sun. The soil was good, well-watered, manured and cared for.  It was a beautiful morning with a clear blue sky, warm and the air was softly pleasant.  The quails in the bushes were fussing about, with their sharp calls; a sparrow-hawk was hovering in the air, motionless, and soon it came down to sit on a branch in the next orange tree and went to sleep.  It was so close that the sharp claws, the marvellous speckled feathers and the sharp beak were clearly visible; it was within the reach of an arm.  It had been earlier in the morning along the avenue of mimosa and the small birds were crying out their alarm. Under the bushes two King snakes, with their dark brown rings along the length of their bodies, were curling around each other, and as they passed close by they were utterly unaware of a human presence. They had been on a shelf in the shed, stretched out, their dark, bright eyes watching and waiting for the mice.  They stared without blinking for they had no eyelids.  They must have been there during the night and now they were among the bushes.  It was their ground and they were seen often, and on picking up one of them, it coiled around the arm and felt cold to the touch.  All those living things seemed to have their own order, their own discipline and their own play and gaiety.

Materialism, that nothing exists but matter, is the prevailing and the persistent activity of human beings who are affluent and those who are not.  There's a whole block of the world which is dedicated to materialism; the structure of its society is based upon this formula, with all its consequences.  The other blocks are also materialistic but some kind of idealistic principles are accepted when it's convenient and discarded under the name of rationality and necessity.  In changing the environment, violently or slowly, revolution or evolution, the behaviour of man is changed according to the culture in which he lives.  It is an age-old conflict between those who believe man is matter and those who pursue the spirit.  This division has brought such misery, confusion, illusion to man.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thought is material and its activity, outer or inner, is materialistic.  Thought is measurable and so it is time.  Within this area, consciousness is matter.  Consciousness is its content; the content is consciousness; they are inseparable.  The content is the many things which thought has put together: the past modifying the present which is the future which is time.  Time is movement within the area which is consciousness, expanded or contracted. Thought is memory, experience and knowledge, and this memory, with its images and its shadows, is the self, the'`me" and the "not me", the "we" and "they".  The essence of division is the self with all its attributes and qualities.  Materialism only gives strength and growth to the self.  The self may and does identify itself with the State, with an ideology, with activities of the "non-me", religious or secular, but it is still the self.  Its beliefs are self-created, as are its pleasures and fears.  Thought by its very nature and structure is fragmentary, and conflict and war are between the various fragments, the nationalities, the races and ideologies.  A materialistic humanity will destroy itself unless the self is wholly abandoned.  The abandonment of the self is always of primary importance.  And only from this revolution a new society can be put together.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The abandonment of the self is love, compassion: passion for all things the starving, the suffering, the homeless and for the materialist and the believer.  Love is not sentimentality, romanticism; it is as strong and final as death.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Slowly the fog from the sea came over the western hills like huge waves; it folded itself over the hills and down into the valley and it would presently reach up here; it would become cooler with the coming darkness of the night.  There would be no stars and there would be complete silence.  It is a factual silence and not the silence which thought has cultivated, in which there is no space. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
