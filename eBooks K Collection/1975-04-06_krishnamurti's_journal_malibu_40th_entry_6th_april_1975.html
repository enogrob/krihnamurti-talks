It is so tender, dazzling, clear and full of mirth.  Occasionally you would see whales blowing on their way north and rarely their enormous head as they threw themselves out of the water.  There was a whole pod of them, blowing; they must be very powerful animals.  That day the sea was a lake, still and utterly quiet, without a single wave; there was not that clear dancing blue.  The sea was asleep and you watched it with wonder.  The house overlooked the sea.  [This is the house where he was staying at Malibu.] It is a beautiful house, with a quiet garden, a green lawn and flowers.  It's a spacious house with the light of the Californian sun.  And rabbits loved it too; they would come early in the morning and late in the evening; they would eat up flowers and the newly planted pansies, marigolds and the small flowering plants.  You couldn't keep them out though there was a wire netting alI around, and to kill them would be a crime.  But a cat and a barn owl brought order to the garden; the black cat wandered about the garden; the owl perched itself during the day among the thick eucalyptus; you could see it, motionless, eyes closed, round and big. The rabbits disappeared and the garden flourished and the blue Pacific flowed effortlessly.

It is only man that brings disorder to the universe.  He's ruthless and extremely violent.  Wherever he is he brings misery and confusion in himself and in the world about him.  He lays waste and destroys and he has no compassion.  In himself there is no order and so what he touches becomes soiled and chaotic.  His politics have become a refined gangsterism of power, deceit, personal or national, group against group.  His economy is restricted and so not universal. His society is immoral, in freedom and under tyranny.  He is not religious though he believes, worships and goes through endless, meaningless rituals. Why has he become like this cruel, irresponsible and so utterly self-centred?  Why?  There are a hundred explanations and those who explain, subtly with words that are born out of knowledge of many books and experiments on animals, are caught in the net of human sorrow, ambition, pride and agony.  The description is not the described, the word is not the thing.  Is it because he is looking for outward causes, the environment conditioning man, hoping the outer change transforms the inner man?  Is it because he's so attached to his senses, dominated by their immediate demands?  Is it because he lives so entirely in the movement of thought and knowledge?  Or is it because he's so romantic, sentimental, that he becomes ruthless with his ideals, make-beliefs and pretensions?  Is it because he is always led, a follower, or becomes a leader, a guru?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This division as the outer and inner is the beginning of his conflict and misery; he is caught in this contradiction, in this ageless tradition.  Caught in this meaningless division, he is lost and becomes a slave to others.  The outer and the inner are imagination and the invention of thought; as thought is fragmentary, it makes for disorder and conflict which is division.  Thought cannot bring about order, an effortless flow of virtue.  Virtue is not the continuous repetition of memory, practice.  Thought-knowledge is time-binding.  Thought by its very nature and structure cannot grasp the whole flow of life, as a total movement.  Thought-knowledge cannot have an insight into this wholeness; it cannot be aware of this choicelessly as long as it remains as the perceiver, the outsider looking in.  Thought-knowledge has no place in perception. The thinker is the thought; the perceiver is the perceived.  Only then is there an effortless movement in our daily life. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
