<FONT size=5 color=black><B>MEDITATIONS 1969 PART 1</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>In the space which thought creates around itself there is no love.  This space divides man from man, and in it is all the becoming, the battle of life, the agony and fear.  Meditation is the ending of this space, the ending of the me.  Then relationship has quite a different meaning, for in that space which is not made by thought, the other does not exist, for you do not exist.  Meditation then is not the pursuit of some vision, however sanctified by tradition.  Rather it is the endless space where thought cannot enter.  To us, the little space made by thought around itself, which is the me,is extremely important, for this is all the mind knows, identifying itself with everything that is in that space.  And the fear of not being is born in that space.  But in meditation, when this is understood, the mind can enter into a dimension of space where action is inaction.  We do not know what love is, for in the space made by thought around itself as the me, love is the conflict of the me and the not-me.  This conflict, this torture, is not love. Thought is the very denial of love, and it cannot enter into that space where the me is not.  In that space is the benediction which man seeks and cannot find.  He seeks it within the frontiers of thought, and thought destroys the ecstasy of this benediction. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
