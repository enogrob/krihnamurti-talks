<FONT size=5 color=black><B>THE FUTURE IS NOW CHAPTER 11 4TH JANUARY 1986 3RD PUBLIC TALK MADRAS</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>WILL YOU KINDLY participate in what he's talking about?  Will you not only follow it, but together participate in it, not just think about it or casually pay attention to it?  One or two things must be made very clear.  This is not a personality cult.  The speaker has an abomination of all that; everything he is saying is contradicted if you personally worship an individual, or make him into a god.  What is important is to listen to what he has to say, share it; not only listen, but actually participate in what he's saying.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We have talked about life, the very complexity of life, the beginning of life.  What is life?  What is the origin of all this - the marvellous earth, the lovely evening and the early morning sun, the rivers, the valleys, the mountains and the glory of the land which is being despoiled?  If you say the origin of all this is `god', then it's finished; then you can trot along quite happily because you've solved the problem.  But if you begin to question, doubt, as one should, all gods, all gurus - I don't belong to that tribe - if you begin to question all that man has put together through a long evolution down the corridors of history, you find this question asked: What is the beginning?  What is the origin?  How has all this come about?  I hope you're asking this question; don't just listen to the speaker, but share it, tear it to pieces.  Don't please, accept anything he says.  He's not your guru; he's not your leader; he's not your helper.  This is the platform, that is the beginning of this talk.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is a very serious talk, and unless your brain is actually active, one is afraid that you won't be able to follow. It would be useless for you and for the speaker to listen to a lot of words, but if we could together take a very long journey, not in terms of time, not in terms of belief or conclusions or theories, but examine very carefully the way of our lives, fear, uncertainty, insecurity and all the inventions that man has made, including the extraordinary computers - where are we at the end of two million years?  Where are we going, not as some theory, not what some wretched book says, however holy it is, but where are we all going? And where have we begun?  They're both related to each other: where are we going, where we began.  The beginning may be the ending. Don't agree.  Find out.  There may be no beginning and no ending, and we're going to investigate into that together.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From the beginning of time, right down to the present day, man has always thought in terms of religion.  What is religion?  Man has always sought something more than this world.  Men have worshipped the stars, the suns, the moons and their own creations; there has been tremendous endeavour, effort, energy, spent on ancient temples, mosques and the churches, of course.  They have spent tremendous energy on this.  What is the spirit of man that has sought something beyond the world, beyond the daily agony; the travail, work, going to the factory, to the office, and climbing the ladder of success, making money, trying to impress people, trying to command?  Are you agreeing to this?  It is a fact whether you agree or not.  They're all seeking power in some form; they want to be at the centre of things - in Delhi, or here, or in other places.  They want to be there.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We're asking: What is religion; what has made man give enormous treasures to a temple; what made him do all this?  What was the energy that was given to all this?  Was it fear?  Was it seeking a reward from heaven, or whatever you like to call it?  Was seeking a reward the origin?  You want a reward; you want something in exchange; you pray three or five times a day and you hope in return that some entity will give you something, from a refrigerator to a car to a better wife, or better husband, or you wait for grace, something that you can hope for, cling to.  This has been the history of all religions.  God and money are always together; the Catholic Church has tremendous treasures.  You have it here, too, in your various temples, puja and worship and all that triviality; all that is really nonsense.  We are trying to find out by enquiring very, very deeply what religion is; it is obviously not all this moneymaking stuff.  We are asking: What is that, which is nameless, which is the supreme intelligence, which has no relationship with all our prayers, with all our gods, temples, mosques, churches?  That's all man-made.  Any intelligent man must put all that aside and not become cynical, not become merely sceptical, but have a brain that's really active, a brain that enquires into everything, not only the outside world.  Have we got a brain that is enquiring into its own thoughts, into its own consciousness, into its own pains, sufferings, all the rest of it? Have we got such a brain?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Here, we must separate the brain from the mind.  The brain is the centre of all our nerves, our knowledge, all our theories, opinions, prejudices; from college, university, all that knowledge is gathered in the skull.  All the thoughts, all the fears are there.  Is the brain different from the mind?  If you seriously pay attention to what the speaker has asked, is there a difference between the brain, your brain, what is inside the skull with all the knowledge you have gathered, not only you, but your forefathers and so on, for two million years, which is all encased in there - is there a difference between that brain and the mind?  The brain will always be limited. Don't agree; this is much too serious.  And is the mind different from this, from my consciousness, from my daily activities, from my fears, anxieties, uncertainties, sorrow, pain and all the theories which man has gathered about everything?  The mind has no relationship with the brain; it can communicate with the brain, but the brain cannot communicate with it. Don't agree, please, that's the last thing to do.  The speaker is saying the brain is the keeper of all our consciousness, of our thoughts, of our fears, and so on, and on, and on.  All the gods, all the theories about gods and the unbelievers, it's all there.  Nobody can dispute that unless he's a little bit odd.  This brain, which is conditioned by knowledge, by experience, by tradition, cannot have any communication with the mind which is totally outside the activity of the brain.  That mind can communicate with the brain, but the brain cannot communicate with it because the brain can imagine infinitely; the brain can imagine the nameless; the brain can do anything.  The mind is too immense because it doesn't belong to you; it's not your mind.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We are going to investigate - together, please bear in mind always together - not only the nature of religion, but also the computer.  You know what the computer is?  It's a machine; it can programme itself.  It can bring about its own computer; the father computer has its own son computer which is better than the father. You don't have to accept this; it's public; it's not something secret, so watch it carefully.  That computer can do almost anything that man can do.  It can make all your gods, all your theories, your rituals; it's even better at it than you will ever be.  So, the computer is coming up in the world; it's going to make your brains something different.  You've heard of genetic engineering; they're trying, whether you like it or not, to change your whole behaviour. That is genetic engineering.  They are trying to change your way of thinking.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When genetic engineering and the computer meet, what are you?  As a human being what are you?  Your brains are going to be altered. Your way of behaviour is going to be changed.  They may remove fear altogether, remove sorrow, remove all your gods.  They're going to; don't fool yourself.  It all ends up either in war or in death.  This is what is happening in the world actually.  Genetic engineering on the one side and the computer on the other, and when they meet, as they're inevitably going to, what are you as a human being?  Actually, your brain now is a machine.  You are born in India and say: `I'm an Indian.' You are encased in that.  You are a machine.  Please don't be insulted.  I'm not insulting you.  You are a machine which repeats like a computer. Don't imagine there is something divine in you - that would be lovely - something holy that is everlasting.  The computer will say that to you too.  So, what is becoming of a human being?  What's becoming of you?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We have also to enquire - this is a very serious subject, don't agree or disagree,just listen - into what is creation.  Not the creation of a baby, that's very simple, or the creation of a new something or other.  Invention is totally different from creation. Invention is based on knowledge.  The engineers can improve the jet; the movement is based on knowledge and the invention is also based on knowledge.  So we must separate invention from creation.  This requires your total energy, your capacity to penetrate.  Invention is essentially based on knowledge.  I improve the clock; I have a new gadget.  All invention is based on knowledge, on experience; inventions are inevitably limited because they're based on knowledge. Knowledge being ever limited, inventions must always be limited.  In the future there may be no jets, but something else that will go from Delhi to Los Angeles in two hours; that's an invention based on previous knowledge which has been improved step by step, but that's not creation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So what is creation?  So what is life?  Life in the tree, life in the little grass - life, not what the scientists invent, but the beginning of life - life, the thing that lives?  You may kill it, but it's still there in the other.  Don't agree or disagree, but see that we are enquiring into the origin of life.  We are going to enquire into the absolute - something that's really marvellous. It's not a reward; you can't take it home and use it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What is meditation to you?  What is meditation?  The word, in common language in the dictionary, means: to ponder over, to think over and to concentrate, to learn to concentrate, not let your brain wander all over the place.  Is that what you call meditation?  Be simple, be honest.  That is what?  Every day taking a certain period and going to a room and sitting down quietly for ten minutes or half an hour to meditate?  Is meditation concentration, thinking about something very noble?  Any conscious effort to meditate is part of your discipline of the office, because you say: If I meditate, I'll have a quiet mind, or I'll enter into another state.  The word `meditation' also means to measure, which means compare.  So your meditation becomes mechanical because you are exercising energy to concentrate on a picture, an image, or an idea, and that concentration divides.  Concentration is always divisive; you want to concentrate on something, but thought wanders off; then you say you mustn't wander off, and you come back.  You repeat that all day long, or for half an hour.  Then you come off it and say you have meditated.  This meditation is advocated by all the gurus, by all the lay disciples.  The Christian idea is: `I believe in God and I'm sacrificing myself to God; therefore, I pray to save my soul.' Is all this meditation?  I know nothing about this kind of meditation; it's like an achievement; if I meditate for half an hour, I feel better. Or is there a totally different kind of meditation?  Don't accept anything that the speaker says, at any price.  The speaker says that that is not meditation at all.  That's merely a process of achievement.  If one day you have not been able to concentrate, you take a month and say: `Yes, I've got it.' That's like a clerk becoming a manager.  So is there a different kind of meditation which is not effort, which is not measurement, which is not routine, which is not mechanical? Is there a meditation in which there is no sense of comparison, or in which there is no reward and punishment?  Is there any meditation which is not based on thought which is measurement, time, and all that?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How can one explain a meditation that has no measurement, that has no achievement, that doesn't say: `I'm this, but I'll become that'?  `That' being god or superangel.  Is there a meditation which has nothing to do with will - an energy that says: `I must meditate'? Is there a meditation which as nothing to do with effort at all?  The speaker says there is.  You don't have to accept it.  He may be talking nonsense, but he sees logically that the ordinary meditation is self-hypnosis, deceiving oneself.  And, when you stop deceiving, stop all that mechanical process, is there a different kind of meditation?  And unfortunately, the speaker says: Yes.  But you can't get at it through effort, through giving all your energy to something.  It is something that has to be absolutely silent.  First of all, begin very humbly, very, very humbly and, therefore, very gently and, therefore, no pushing, driving, saying: `I must do this.' It requires a tremendous sense not only of aloneness, but a sense of - I mustn't describe it to you.  I mustn't describe it because then you'll go off on descriptions.  If I describe it, the description is not the real.  The description of the moon is not the moon, and a painting of the Himalayas is not the Himalayas.  So, we'll stop describing.  It's for you to play with it, or not play with it, going your own way with your own peculiar achievements through meditation, reward and all the rest of it.  So, in meditation which is absolutely no effort, no achievement, no thinking, the brain is quiet; not made quiet by will, by intention, by conclusion and all that nonsense; it is quiet.  And, being quiet, it has infinite space. Are you waiting for me to explore?  And you will follow what I explain?  What kind of people are you? So, is your brain ever quiet?  I'm asking you.  Your brain is thinking, fearing, thinking of your office work, of your family, what they will do, your sons, your daughters; thinking, which is time and thought.  Is your brain ever quiet?  Not made quiet by drugs, whiskey and various forms of drugging yourself.  You drug yourself when you believe.  You drug yourself and say: `Yes, this is perfectly right, the Buddha has said that, therefore it must be right.  You're drugging yourself all the time; therefore, you have no energy of that kind that demands the penetration of something immense.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, we're now going back to find out what creation is.  What is creation?  It has nothing to do with invention.  So what is creation, the origin, the beginning?  What is life?  Tell me what you think of it.  What is life?  Not going to the office and all the rest of it, sex and children, or no children but sex and so on and so on and so on.  What is life?  What gives life to that blade of grass in the cement?  What is life in us?  Not all the things that we go through - power, position, prestige, fame, or no fame, but shame; that's not life; that's part of our mishandling of life.  But, what is life?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why are you listening to me?  What makes you, if you are listening at all, listen to the man?  What is the motive behind your listening?  What do you want?  What's your desire?  Behind the desire there is a motive.  So what is desire?  Desire is part of sensation, isn't it?  I see this beautiful clock or ugly clock; it's a sensation.  The seeing brings about a sensation.  From that sensation, thought comes and makes an image of it.  That is, I see this clock, rather nice, I would like to have it.  The sensation of seeing, then thought coming and making an image of that sensation; at that moment, desire is born.  It's very simple.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Is there a brain, your brain, which is not muddied up, muddied by environment, by tradition, by society and all the rest of it?  So what is the origin of life?  Are you waiting for me to answer it?  This is much too serious a subject for you to play with, because we are trying to enquire into something that has no name, no end.  I can kill that bird; there is another bird.  I can't kill all birds; there are too many of them in the world.  So, we are enquiring into what makes a bird.  What is creation behind all this? Are you waiting for me to describe it, go into it?  You want me to go into it?  Why
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(From the audience: To understand what creation is.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why do you ask that?  Because I asked?  No description can ever describe the origin.  The origin is nameless; the origin is absolutely quiet, it's not whirring about making noise.  Creation is something that is most holy, that's the most sacred thing in life, and if you have made a mess of your life, change it.  Change it today, not tomorrow.  If you are uncertain, find out why and be certain.  If your thinking is not straight, think straight, logically.  Unless all that is prepared, all that is settled, you can't enter into this world, into the world of creation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It ends.  (These two words are hardly audible, breathed rather than spoken.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is the last talk.  Do you want to sit together quietly for a while?  All right, sirs, sit quietly for a while. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
