<FONT size=5 color=black><B>COMMENTARIES ON LIVING SERIES I CHAPTER 11 'POLITICS'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>HIGH UP IN the mountains it had been raining all day.  It was not a soft, gentle rain, but one of those torrential downpours that wash out roads and uproot trees on the hillside, causing landslides and noisy streams which become quiet in a few hours.  A little boy, soaked to the skin, was playing in a shallow pool and paying not the least attention to the angry and high-pitched voice of his mother.  A cow was coming down the muddy road as we climbed it.  The clouds seemed to open and cover the land with water.  We were wet through and removed most of our clothing, and the rain was pleasant on the skin.  The house was way up on the mountainside, and the town lay below.  A strong wind was blowing from the west, bringing more dark and furious clouds.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There was a fire in the room, and several people were waiting to talk things over.  The rain, beating on the windows, had made a large puddle on the floor, and the water even came down the chimney, making the fire sputter.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He was a very famous politician, realistic, intensely sincere and ardently patriotic.  Neither narrow-minded not self-seeking his ambition was not for himself, but for an idea and for the people.  He was not a mere eloquent tub thumper or vote catcher; he had suffered for his cause and, strangely, was not bitter.  He seemed more of a scholar than a politician.  But politics was the bread of his life, and his party obeyed him, though rather nervously.  He was a dreamer, but he had put all that aside for politics.  His friend, the leading economist, was also there; he had intricate theories and facts concerning the distribution of enormous revenues.  He seemed to be familiar with the economists of both the left and the right, and he had his own theories for the economic salvation of mankind.  He talked easily, and there was no hesitation for words.  Both of them had harangued huge crowds.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Have you noticed, in newspapers and magazines, the amount of space given to politics, to the sayings of politicians and their activities?  Of course, other news is given, but political news predominates; the economic and political life has become all-important.  The outward circumstances - comfort, money, position and power - seem to dominate and shape our existence.  The external show - the title, the garb, the salute, the flag - has become increasingly significant, and the total process of life has been forgotten or deliberately set aside.  It is so much easier to throw oneself into social and political activity than to understand life as a whole; to be associated with any organized thought, with political or religious activity, offers a respectable escape from the pettiness and drudgery of everyday life.  With a small heart you can talk of big things and of the popular leaders; you can hide your shallowness with the easy phrases of world affairs; your restless mind can happily and with popular encouragement settle down to propagate the ideology of a new or of an old religion.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Politics is the reconciliation of effects; and as most of us are concerned with effects, the external has assumed dominant significance.  By manipulating effects we hope to bring about order and peace; but, unfortunately, it is not as simple as all that.  Life is a total process, the inner as well as the outer; the outer definitely affects the inner, but the inner invariably overcomes the outer.  What you are, you bring about outwardly.  The outer and the inner cannot be separated and kept in watertight compartments, for they are constantly interacting upon each other; but the inner craving, the hidden pursuits and motives, are always more powerful. Life is not dependent upon political or economic activity; life is not a mere outward show, any more than a tree is the leaf or the branch.  Life is a total process whose beauty is to be discovered only in its integration.  This integra- tion does not take place on the superficial level of political and economic reconciliations; it is to be found beyond causes and effects.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Because we play with causes and effects and never go beyond them, except verbally, our lives are empty, without much significance.  It is for this reason that we have become slaves to political excitement and to religious sentimentalism.  There is hope only in the integration of the several processes of which we are made up.  This integration does not come into being through any ideology, or through following any particular authority, religious or political; it comes into being only through extensive and deep awareness.  This awareness must go into the deeper layers of consciousness and not be content with surface responses. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
