<FONT size=5 color=black><B>KRISHNAMURTI'S JOURNAL MALIBU 36TH ENTRY 1ST APRIL 1975</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>Even so early in the morning the sun was hot and burning.  There wasn't a breeze and not a leaf was stirring.  In the ancient temple it was cool and pleasant; the bare feet were aware of the solid slabs of rocks, their shapes and their unevenness.  Many thousands of people must have walked on them for a thousand years.  It was dark there after the glare of the morning sun and in the corridors there seemed to be few people that morning and in the narrow passage it was still darker.  This passage led to a wide corridor which led to the inner shrine.  There was a strong smell of flowers and the incense of many centuries.  And a hundred Brahmanas, freshly bathed, in newly washed white loin cloths, were chanting.  Sanskrit is a powerful language, resonant with depth.  The ancient walls were vibrating, almost shaking to the sound of a hundred voices.  The dignity of the sound was incredible and the sacredness of the moment was beyond the words.  It was not the words that awakened this immensity but the depth of the sound of many thousand years held within these walls and in the immeasurable space beyond them.  It was not the meaning of those words, nor the clarity of their pronunciation, nor the dark beauty of the temple but the quality of sound that broke walls and the limitations of the human mind.  The song of a bird, the distant flute, the breeze among the leaves, all these break down the walls that human beings have created for themselves.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the great cathedrals and lovely mosques, the chants and the intoning of their sacred books it is the sound that opens the heart, to tears and beauty.  Without space there's no beauty; without space you have only walls and measurements; without space there's no depth; without space there's only poverty, inner and outer.  You have so little space in your mind; it's so crammed full of words, remembrances, knowledge, experiences and problems. There's hardly any space left, only the everlasting chatter of thought.  And so your museums are filled and every shelf with books. Then you fill the places of entertainment, religious or otherwise. Or you build a wall around yourself, a narrow space of mischief and pain.  Without space, inner or outer, you become violent and ugly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Everything needs space to live, to play and to chant.  That which is sacred cannot love without space.  You have no space when you hold, when there is sorrow, when you become the centre of the universe.  The space that you occupy is the space that thought has built around you and that is misery and confusion.  The space that thought measures is the division between you and me, we and they. This division is endless pain.  There's that solitary tree in a wide, green, open field. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
