<FONT size=5 color=black><B>KRISHNAMURTI TO HIMSELF OJAI CALIFORNIA THURSDAY 12TH MAY, 1983</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>IT IS DAWN in these northern latitudes.  In these latitudes dawn begins very early and lasts a long time.  It is one of the most beautiful things on earth, the beginning of a dawn and the beginning of a day.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After a stormy night, the trees battered about, the leaves shaken and dry branches broken, the long pursuing winds have cleansed the air, which is dry.  The dawn was so slowly creeping over the earth; it had an extraordinary quality this morning, especially this morning - it is probably after the winds of yesterday.  But this dawn on this particular day was something more than the dawn of other days.  It was so utterly quiet.  You hardly dared to breathe for fear of disturbing anything.  The leaves were still, even the most tender leaves.  It was as though the whole earth were holding its breath, probably in great adoration.  And slowly the sun touched the top of the mountains, orange, yellow, and there were specks of light on other hills.  And still there was great silence.  Then the noises began - the song of birds, the red-tailed hawk hovering in the sky, and the dove began its mourning song - but the silence of the dawn was in the morning, in the whole earth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you walk down below the hill, high across the valley, past the orange groves and some green lawns, past the tall slender eucalyptus, you come to a hill on which there are many buildings.  It is an institute for something or other, and across the valley there is a long golf course, beautifully kept; we have played on it long ago. One has forgotten the course, the bunkers, but there it still is, very carefully maintained.  One sees quite a lot of people with heavy bags playing on it.  In the old days one had a bag of only six clubs but now there are about a dozen.  It is getting too professional, too expensive.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You come over to another hill, and there too there are several institutions, foundations, organizations of almost every kind.  All over the world there are dozens of institutions, forums, inner and outer directive groups.  Everywhere you go in the so-called free world there is every kind of institution, organization, forum, to do this and to do that, to bring peace to man, to preserve the wilderness, to save the various animals and so on.  It is quite bewildering and quite common now - groups of this and groups of that, each group with its own leaders, its own presidents and secretaries, the man who started it and the others who followed him.  It is quite extraordinary, all these little organizations and institutions.  And slowly they begin to deteriorate; probably it is inherent in all institutions, including the institutions that help man outwardly, like the institutions for greater knowledge.  Those are probably necessary, but one is rather startled that there are also these inner directed groups of various types which do different kinds of meditation.  They are rather curious those two words `inner directed' - who is the director and what is the direction?  Is the director different from the direction?  We never seem to ask fundamental questions.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are organizations to help man in the physical world, controlled by men who in themselves have their problems and their ambitions and achievements, worshipping success, but that seems to be almost inevitable and that kind of thing has been going on for thousands and thousands of years.  But are there institutions to study man or bring peace to man?  Do various systems, based on some conclusion, actually help man?  Apparently all the organizers in the world feel they do, but have they actually helped man to be free from his sorrow, pain, anxiety and all the travail of life?  Can an outside agency, however exalted, however established in some kind of mystical ideational tradition, in any way change man?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What will fundamentally bring about a radical change in man's brutality, end the wars he has been through and the constant conflict in which he lives?  Will knowledge help him?  If you like to use that word, evolution - man has evolved through knowledge.  from ancient days he has gathered a great deal of information, knowledge about the world around him, above him, from the bullock cart to the jet, from the jet to going to the moon, and so on.  There is tremendous advancement in all this.  But has this knowledge in any way put an end to his selfishness, to his aggressive, competitive recklessness?  Knowledge, after all, is to be aware of and to know all the things of the world, how the world was created, the achievements of man from the beginning to the present day.  We are all well informed, some more, some less, but inwardly we are very primitive, almost barbarous, however cultured we may be outwardly, however well informed about many, many things, able to argue, to convince, to come to some decisions and conclusions.  This can go on endlessly outwardly.  There are dozens and dozens of specialists of every kind, but one asks seriously: can any kind of outside agency, including god, help man to end his grief, his utter loneliness, confusion, anxiety and so on?  Or must he always live with that, put up with it, get used to it and say that it is part of life?  The vast majority of mankind throughout the world tolerate it, accept it.  Or they have institutions to pray to something outside - pray for peace, hold demonstrations for peace, but there is no peace in the heart of man.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What will change man?  He has suffered endlessly, caught in the network of fear, ever pursuing pleasure.  This has been the course of his life, and nothing seems to change it.  Instead of being cynical about it all, or bitter, or angry, it is like that, life is that, and we ask, how can all that be changed?  Certainly not by an outside agency.  Man has to face it, not avoid it, and examine it without asking for any aid; he is master of himself.  He has made this society, he is responsible for it, and this very responsibility demands that he bring about a change in himself.  But very few pay attention to all this.  For the vast mass of people, their thinking is so utterly indifferent, irresponsible, seeking to fulfil their own selfish life, sublimating their desires but still remaining selfish.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To look at all this is not being a pessimist or trying to be an optimist.  One has to look at all this.  And you are the only one who can change yourself and the society in which you live.  That is a fact, and you can't escape from it.  If you do escape from it then you are never going to have peace on this earth, never an abiding sense of joy, a sense of bliss.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The dawn is over and a new day has begun.  It is really a new day, a new morning.  And when one looks around, one wonders at the beauty of the land and the trees and the richness of it.  It is really a new day and the wonder of it is, it is there. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
