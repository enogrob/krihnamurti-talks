<FONT size=5 color=black><B>COMMENTARIES ON LIVING SERIES I CHAPTER 18 'THE KNOWN AND THE UNKNOWN'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>THE LONG EVENING shadows were over the still waters, and the river was becoming quiet after the day.  Fish were jumping out of the water, and the heavy birds were coming to roost among the big trees. There was not a cloud in the sky, which was silver-blue.  A boat full of people came down the river; they were singing and clapping, and a cow called in the distance.  There was the scent of evening.  A garland of marigold was moving with the water, which sparkled in the setting sun.  How beautiful and alive it all was - the river, the birds, the trees and the villagers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We were sitting under a tree, overlooking the river.  Near the tree was a small temple, and a few lean cows wandered about.  The temple was clean and well swept, and the flowering bush was watered and cared for.  A man was performing his evening rituals, and his voice was patient and sorrowful.  Under the last rays of the sun, the water was the colour of newborn flowers.  Presently someone joined us and began to talk of his experiences.  He said he had devoted many years of his life to the search for God, had practised many austerities and renounced many things that were dear.  He had also helped considerably in social work, in building a school, and so on. He was interested in many things, but his consuming interest was the finding of God; and now, after many years, His voice was being heard, and it guided him in little as well as big things.  He had no will of his own, but followed the inner voice of God.  It never failed him, though he often corrupted its clarity; his prayer was ever for the purification of the vessel, that it might be worthy to receive.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Can that which is immeasurable be found by you and me?  Can that which is not of time be searched out by that thing which is fashioned of time?  Can a diligently practised discipline lead us to the unknown?  Is there a means to that which has no beginning and no end? Can that reality be caught in the net of our desires?  What we can capture is the projection of the known; but the unknown cannot be captured by the known.  That which is named is not the unnameable, and by naming we only awaken the conditioned responses.  These responses, however noble and pleasant, are not of the real.  We respond to stimulants, but reality offers no stimulant: it is.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The mind moves from the known to the known, and it cannot reach out into the unknown.  You cannot think of something you do not know; it is impossible.  What you think about comes out of the known, the past, whether that past be remote, or the second that has just gone by.  This past is thought, shaped and conditioned by many influences, modifying itself according to circumstances and pressures, but ever remaining a process of time.  Thought can only deny or assert it cannot discover or search out the new.  Thought cannot come upon the new.  but when thought is silent, then there may be the new - which is immediately transformed into the old, into the experienced, by thought.  Thought is ever shaping, modifying, colouring according to a pattern of experience. The function of thought is to communicate but not to be in the state of experiencing.  When experiencing ceases, then thought takes over and terms it within the category of the known.  Thought cannot penetrate into the unknown, and so it can never discover or experience reality.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Disciplines, renunciations, detachment, rituals, the practice of virtue - all these, however noble, are the process of thought; and thought can only work towards an end, towards an achievement, which is ever the known.  Achievement is security, the self-protective certainty of the known.  To seek security in that which is nameless is to deny it.  The security that may be found is only in the projection of the past, of the known.  For this reason the mind must be entirely and deeply silent; but this silence cannot be purchased through sacrifice, sublimation or suppression.  This silence comes when the mind is no longer seeking, no longer caught in the process of becoming.  This silence is not cumulative, it may not be built up through practice.  The silence must be as unknown to the mind as the timeless; for if the mind experiences the silence, then there is the experiencer who is the result of past experiences, who is cognizant of a past silence; and what is experienced by the experiencer is merely a self-projected repetition.  The mind can never experience the new, and so the mind must be utterly still.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The mind can be still only when it is not experiencing, that is, when it is not terming or naming, recording or storing up in memory. This naming and recording is a constant process of the different layers of consciousness, not merely of the upper mind.  But when the superficial mind is quiet, the deeper mind can offer up its intimations.  When the whole consciousness is silent and tranquil, free from all becoming, which is spontaneity then only does the immeasurable come into being.  The desire to main- tain this freedom gives continuity to the memory of the becomer, which is a hindrance to reality.  Reality has no continuity; it is from moment to moment, ever new, ever fresh.  What has continuity can never be creative.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The upper mind is only an instrument of communication it cannot measure that which is immeasurable.  Reality is not to be spoken of; and when it is, it is no longer reality.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is meditation.
