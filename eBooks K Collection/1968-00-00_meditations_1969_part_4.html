<FONT size=5 color=black><B>MEDITATIONS 1969 PART 4</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>Meditation is one of the most extraordinary things, and if you do not know what it is you are like the blind man in a world of bright colour, shadows and moving light.  It is not an intellectual affair, but when the heart enters into the mind, the mind has quite a different quality: it is really, then, limitless, not only in its capacity to think, to act efficiently, but also in its sense of living in a vast space where you are part of everything.  Meditation is the movement of love.  It isn't the love of the one or of the many.  It is like water that anyone can drink out of any jar, whether golden or earthenware: it is inexhaustible.  And a peculiar thing takes place which no drug or self-hypnosis can bring about: it is as though the mind enters into itself, beginning at the surface and penetrating ever more deeply, until depth and height have lost their meaning and every form of measurement ceases.  In this state there is complete peace not contentment which has come about through gratification but a peace that has order, beauty and intensity.  It can all be destroyed, as you can destroy a flower, and yet because of its very vulnerability it is indestructible.  This meditation cannot be learned from another.  You must begin without knowing anything about it, and move from innocence to innocence.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The soil in which the meditative mind can begin is the soil of everyday life, the strife, the pain, and the fleeting joy.  It must begin there, and bring order, and from there move endlessly.  But if you are concerned only with making order, then that very order will bring about its own limitation, and the mind will be its prisoner. In all this movement you must somehow begin from the other end, from the other shore, and not always be concerned with this shore or how to cross the river.  You must take a plunge into the water, not knowing how to swim.  And the beauty of meditation is that you never know where you are, where you are going, what the end is. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
