<FONT size=5 color=black><B>THE WHOLENESS OF LIFE PART II CHAPTER 10 5TH PUBLIC TALK SAANEN 19TH JULY 1977 'THE STATE OF THE MIND THAT HAS INSIGHT IS COMPLETELY EMPTY.'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>An awakened intelligence has a deep, true, insight into all our psychological problems, crises, blockages and so on; not intellectual comprehension, not the resolving of problems through conflict. Having an insight into a human issue is to awaken this intelligence; or, having this intelligence, there is the insight - both ways.  In such insight there is no conflict; when you see something very clearly, when you see the truth of the matter, there is the end of it, you do not fight against it, you do not try to control, you do not make all manner of calculated, motivated, efforts.  From that insight, which is intelligence, there is action - not postponed action but immediate action.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We are educated from childhood to exercise, as deeply as possible, every form of effort.  If you observe yourself you will see what tremendous efforts we make to control ourselves, to suppress, adjust and modify ourselves to certain patterns or objectives that you or another have established; so there is constant struggle.  We live with it and we die with it.  And we ask: Is it possible to live our daily life without a single conflict?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Most of us are awakened to all the problems, political, religious, economic, social, ideological and so on, in which we live. Being somewhat aware of all that most of us are discontent.  When you are young, this dissatisfaction becomes like a flame and you have a passion to do something.  So you join some political party, the extreme Left, the extreme revolutionary, the extreme forms of "Jesus freaks" and so on and so on.  By joining these things, by adopting certain attitudes, certain ideologies, that flame of discontent fades away and you then appear to be satisfied.  You say: "This is what I want to do" and you pour your heart into it.  But gradually you find, if you are at all awake to the problems involved, that you are not satisfied.  It is too late; you have already given half your life to something which you thought would be completely worthwhile and you have found later on that it is not so; then your energy, capacity and drive has withered away.  Gradually the real flame of discontent has withered away.  You must have noticed the pattern that has been followed all the time, generation after generation, in yourself,in your children, in the young and the old.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But if you are alive to all these things and are discontented and if you do not allow this discontent to be squashed by the desire to be satisfied, by the desire to adjust oneself to the environment, to the "establishment", or to an ideal, to a Utopia, if you allow this flame to keep on burning, not being satisfied with anything, then the superficial satisfactions have no place; then this very dissatisfaction is demanding something much greater and the ideals, the gurus, the religions, the "establishment", become totally superficial.  This flame of discontent, because it has no outlet, because it has no object in which it can fulfil itself, that flame becomes a great passion.  That passion is intelligence.  If you are not caught in these superficial, essentially reactionary things, then that extraordinary flame is intensified.  That intensity brings about a quality of mind having a deep insight instantly into things, and from that there is action.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Such dissatisfaction does not make you neurotic or bring about imbalance.  There is imbalance only when this dissatisfaction is translated, or caught in a trap of some kind or another; then there is distortion, then there are all kinds of fights, inwardly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you have been caught in these various traps, can you put them aside, wipe them out, destroy them? - do what you like, but have this tremendous flame of discontent now.  It does not mean that you throw bombs at people, destroy, indulge in physical revolution and riots. When you put aside all the traps that man has created around you and that you have created for yourself, then this flame becomes a supreme intelligence.  And that intelligence gives you insight.  And when you have insight, from that there is immediate action.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Action is not tomorrow.  There is an action without cause; it has been a problem for many great thinkers; action without cause, action without motive, action not dependent on some ideology.  One of the demands of serious people is to find out if there is an action which is per se, for itself; which is without cause and motive.  See what is implied in it: no regrets, no retention of those regrets and all the sequence that follows from those regrets, such action does not depend on some past or future ideology; it is an action which is always free.  It is an action that is only possible when there is insight born of intelligence.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Most people would say that there must be conflict otherwise there is no growth; that conflict is part of life.  A tree in a forest struggles to reach the sun; that is a form of conflict.  Every animal is in conflict.  And we human beings, supposed to be intelligent, are yet constantly in conflict.  Now discontent says: "Why should I be in conflict?" Conflict implies comparison, imitation, conformity, adjustment to a pattern, the modified continuity of what has been, through the present, to the future - all a process of conflict.  The deeper the conflict the more neurotic you become.  And so, in order to have respite from conflict you believe most deeply in God, saying: "His will be done" - and we create this monstrous world.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Conflict implies comparison.  Can one live without comparison? which means no ideal, no authority of a pattern, no conformity to a particular ideology.  It implies freedom from the prison of ideas so that there is no comparison, no imitation, no conformity; therefore you are stuck with "what is" - actually what is.  Comparison comes only when you compare "what is" with "what should be", or "what might be", or try to transform "what is" into something which it is not and all this implies conflict.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To live without comparison is to remove a tremendous burden.  If you remove the burden of comparison, imitation, conformity, adjustment, modification, then you are left with "what is".  Conflict arises only when you try to do something with "what is", try to transform it, to modify it, to change it, or to suppress it, run away from it.  But if you have an insight into "what is" then conflict ceases; you are left with "what is".  And what happens to "what is"? What is the state of your mind when you are looking at "what is"? What is the state of your mind when you are not escaping, not trying to transform, or deform "what is"?  What is the state of that mind that is looking and has insight?  The state of the mind that has insight is completely empty.  It is free from escapes, free from suppression, analysis and so on.  When all these burdens are taken away - because you see the absurdity of them, it is like taking away a heavy burden - there is freedom.  Freedom implies an emptiness to observe.  That emptiness gives you insight into violence - not the various forms of violence, but the whole nature of violence and the structure of violence; therefore there is immediate action about violence, which is to be free, completely, from all violence. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
