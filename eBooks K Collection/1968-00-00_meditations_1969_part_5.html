<FONT size=5 color=black><B>MEDITATIONS 1969 PART 5</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>Is there a new experience in meditation?  The desire for experience, the higher experience which is beyond and above the daily or the commonplace, is what keeps the well-spring empty.  The craving for more experience, for visions, for higher perception, for some realization or other, makes the mind look outward, which is no different from its dependence on environment and people.  The curious part of meditation is that an event is not made into an experience. It is there, like a new star in the heavens, without memory taking it over and holding it, without the habitual process of recognition and response in terms of like and dislike.  Our search is always outgoing; the mind seeking any experience is outgoing.  Inward-going is not a search at all; it is perceiving.  Response is always repetitive, for it comes always from the same bank of memory. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
