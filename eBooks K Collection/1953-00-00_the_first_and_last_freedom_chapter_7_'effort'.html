<FONT size=5 color=black><B>THE FIRST AND LAST FREEDOM CHAPTER 7 'EFFORT'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>FOR MOST OF US, our whole life is based on effort, some kind of volition.  We cannot conceive of an action without volition, without effort; our life is based on it.  Our social, economic and so-called spiritual life is a series of efforts, always culminating in a certain result.  And we think effort is essential, necessary.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why do we make effort?  Is it not, put simply, in order to achieve a result, to become something, to reach a goal?  If we do not make an effort, we think we shall stagnate.  We have an idea about the goal towards which we are constantly striving; and this striving has become part of our life.  If we want to alter ourselves, if we want to bring about a radical change in ourselves, we make a tremendous effort to eliminate the old habits, to resist the habitual environmental influences and so on.  So we are used to this series of efforts in order to find or achieve something, in order to live at all.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Is not all such effort the activity of the self?  Is not effort self-centred activity?  If we make an effort from the centre of the self, it must inevitably produce more conflict, more confusion, more misery.  Yet we keep on making effort after effort.  Very few of us realize that the self-centred activity of effort does not clear up any of our problems.  On the contrary, it increases our confusion and our misery and our sorrow.  We know this; and yet we continue hoping somehow to break through this self-centred activity of effort, the action of the will.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think we shall understand the significance of life if we understand what it means to make an effort.  Does happiness come through effort?  Have you ever tried to be happy?  It is impossible, is it not?  You struggle to be happy and there is no happiness, is there?  Joy does not come through suppression, through control or indulgence.  You may indulge but there is bitterness at the end.  You may suppress or control, but there is always strife in the hidden. Therefore happiness does not come through effort, nor joy through control and suppression; and still all our life is a series of suppressions, a series of controls, a series of regretful indulgences.  Also there is a constant overcoming, a constant struggle with our passions, our greed and our stupidity.  So do we not strive, struggle, make effort, in the hope of finding happiness, finding something which will give us a feeling of peace, a sense of love?  Yet does love or understanding come by strife?  I think it is very important to understand what we mean by struggle, strife or effort.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Does not effort mean a struggle to change what is into what is not, or into what it should be or should become?  That is we are constantly struggling to avoid facing what is, or we are trying to get away from it or to transform or modify what is.  A man who is truly content is the man who understands what is, gives the right significance to what is.  That is true contentment; it is not concerned with having few or many possessions but with the understanding of the whole significance of what is; and that can only come when you recognize what is, when you are aware of it, not when you are trying to modify it or change it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So we see that effort is a strife or a struggle to transform that which is into something which you wish it to be.  I am only talking about psychological struggle, not the struggle with a physical problem, like engineering or some discovery or transformation which is purely technical.  I am only talking of that struggle which is psychological and which always overcomes the technical.  You may build with great care a marvellous society, using the infinite knowledge science has given us.  But so long as the psychological strife and struggle and battle are not understood and the psychological overtones and currents are not overcome, the structure of society, however marvellously built, is bound to crash, as has happened over and over again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Effort is a distraction from what is.  The moment I accept what is there is no struggle.  Any form of struggle or strife is an indication of distraction; and distraction, which is effort, must exist so long as psychologically I wish to transform what is into something it is not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
First we must be free to see that joy and happiness do not come through effort.  Is creation through effort, or is there creation only with the cessation of effort?  When do you write, paint or sing? When do you create?  Surely when there is no effort, when you are completely open, when on all levels you are in complete communication, completely integrated.  Then there is joy and then you begin to sing or write a poem or paint or fashion something.  The moment of creation is not born of struggle.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Perhaps in understanding the question of creativeness we shall be able to understand what we mean by effort.  Is creativeness the outcome of effort, and are we aware in those moments when we are creative?  Or is creativeness a sense of total self-forgetfulness, that sense when there is no turmoil, when one is wholly unaware of the movement of thought, when there is only a complete, full, rich being?  is that state the result of travail, of struggle, of conflict, of effort?  I do not know if you have ever noticed that when you do something easily, swiftly, there is no effort, there is complete absence of struggle; but as our lives are mostly a series of battles, conflicts and struggles, we cannot imagine a life, a state of being, in which strife has fully ceased.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To understand the state of being without strife, that state of creative existence, surely one must inquire into the whole problem of effort.  We mean by effort the striving to fulfil oneself, to become something, don't we?  I am this, and I want to become that; I am not that, and I must become that.  In becoming `that', there is strife, there is battle, conflict, struggle.  In this struggle we are concerned inevitably with fulfilment through the gaining of an end; we seek self-fulfilment in an object, in a person, in an idea, and that demands constant battle, struggle, the effort to become, to fulfil.  So we have taken this effort as inevitable; and I wonder if it is inevitable - this struggle to become something?  Why is there this struggle?  Where there is the desire for fulfilment, in whatever degree and at whatever level, there must be struggle.  Fulfilment is the motive, the drive behind the effort; whether it is in the big executive, the housewife, or a poor man, there is this battle to become, to fulfil, going on.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now why is there the desire to fulfil oneself?  Obviously, the desire to fulfil, to become something, arises when there is awareness of being nothing.  Because I am nothing, because I am insufficient, empty, inwardly poor, I struggle to become something; outwardly or inwardly I struggle to fulfil myself in a person, in a thing, in an idea.  To fill that void is the whole process of our existence. Being aware that we are empty, inwardly poor, we struggle either to collect things outwardly, or to cultivate inward riches.  There is effort only when there is an escape from that inward void through action, through contemplation, through acquisition, through achievement, through power, and so on.  That is our daily existence. I am aware of my insufficiency, my inward poverty, and I struggle to run away from it or to fill it.  This running away, avoiding, or trying to cover up the void, entails struggle, strife, effort.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now if one does not make an effort to run away, what happens? One lives with that loneliness, that emptiness; and in accepting that emptiness one will find that there comes a creative state which has nothing to do with strife, with effort.  Effort exists only so long as we are trying to avoid that inward loneliness, emptiness, but when we look at it, observe it, when we accept what is without avoidance, we will find there comes a state of being in which all strife ceases. That state of being is creativeness and it is not the result of strife. But when there is understanding of what is, which is emptiness, inward insufficiency, when one lives with that insufficiency and understands it fully, there comes creative reality, creative intelligence, which alone brings happiness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Therefore action as we know it is really reaction, it is a ceaseless becoming, which is the denial, the avoidance of what is; but when there is awareness of emptiness without choice, without condemnation or justification, then in that understanding of what is there is action, and this action is creative being.  You will understand this if you are aware of yourself in action.  Observe yourself as you are acting, not only outwardly but see also the movement of your thought and feeling.  When you are aware of this movement you will see that the thought process, which is also feeling and action, is based on an idea of becoming.  The idea of becom1ng arises only when there is a sense of insecurity, and that sense of insecurity comes when one is aware of the inward void.  If you are aware of that process of thought and feeling, you will see that there is a constant battle going on, an effort to change, to modify, to alter what is.  This is the effort to become, and becoming is a direct avoidance of what is.  Through self-knowledge, through constant awareness, you will find that strife, battle, the conflict of becoming, leads to pain, to sorrow and ignorance.  It is only if you are aware of inward insufficiency and live with it without escape, accepting it wholly, that you will discover an extraordinary tranquillity, a tranquillity which is not put together, made up, but a tranquillity which comes with understanding of what is.  Only in that state of tranquillity is there creative being. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
