<FONT size=5 color=black><B>KRISHNAMURTI'S JOURNAL BROCKWOOD PARK 5TH ENTRY 18TH SEPTEMBER 1973</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>It is still one of the most beautiful valleys.  It is entirely surrounded by hills, filled with orange groves.  Many years ago there were very few houses among the trees and orchards but now there are many more; the roads are wider, more traffic, more noise, especially at the west end of the valley.  But the hills and high peaks remain the same, untouched by man.  There are many trails leading to the high mountains and one walked endlessly along them.  One met bears, rattle snakes, deer and once a bob cat (a lynx).  The bob cat was there ahead, down the narrow trail, purring and rubbing himself against rocks and the short trunks of trees.  The breeze was coming up the canyon and so one could get quite close to him.  He was really enjoying himself, delighted with his world.  His short tail was up, his pointed ears straight forward, his russet hair bright and clean, totally unaware that someone was just behind him about twenty feet away.  We went down the trail for about a mile, neither of us making the least sound.  It was really a beautiful animal, spritely and graceful.  There was a narrow stream ahead of us and wishing not to frighten him when we came to it, one whispered a gentle greeting.  He never looked round, that would have been a waste of time, but streaked off, completely disappearing in a few seconds.  We had been friends, though, for a considerable time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The valley is filled with the smell of orange blossom, almost overpowering, especially in the early mornings and evening.  It was in the room, in the valley and in every corner of the earth and the god of flowers blessed the valley.  It would be really hot in the summer and that had its own peculiarity.  Many years ago, when one went there, there was a marvellous atmosphere; it is still there to a lesser degree.  Human beings are spoiling it as they seem to spoil most things.  It will be as before.  A flower may wither and die but it will come back with its loveliness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Have you ever wondered why human beings go wrong, become corrupt, indecent in their behaviour aggressive, violent and cunning?  It's no good blaming the environment, the culture or the parents.  We want to put the responsibility for this degeneration on others or on some happening.  Explanations and causes are an easy way out.  The ancient Hindus called it Karma, what you sowed you reaped.  The psychologists put the problem in the lap of the parents.  What the so-called religious people say is based on their dogma and belief.  But the question is still there.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then there are others, born generous, kind, responsible.  They are not changed by the environment or any pressure.  They remain the same in spite of all the clamour.  Why?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Any explanation is of little significance.  All explanations are escapes, avoiding the reality of what is.  This is the only thing that matters.  The what is can be totally transformed with the energy that is wasted in explanations and in searching out the causes.  Love is not in time nor in analysis, in regrets and recriminations.  It is there when desire for money, position and the cunning deceit of the self are not. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
