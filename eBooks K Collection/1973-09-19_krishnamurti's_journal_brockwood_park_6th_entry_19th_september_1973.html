<FONT size=5 color=black><B>KRISHNAMURTI'S JOURNAL BROCKWOOD PARK 6TH ENTRY 19TH SEPTEMBER 1973</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>The monsoon had set in.  The sea was almost black under the dark heavy clouds and the wind was tearing at the trees.  It would rain for a few days, torrential rains, and it would stop for a day or so, to begin again.  Frogs were croaking in every pond and the pleasant smell the rains brought filled the air.  The earth was clean again and in a few days it became astonishingly green.  Things grew almost under your eyes; the sun would come and all the things of the earth would be sparkling.  Early in the morning there would be chanting and the small squirrels were all over the place.  There were flowers everywhere, the wild ones and the cultivated, the jasmine, the rose and the marigold.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One day on the road that leads to the sea, walking under the palms and the heavy rain trees, looking at a thousand things, a group of children were singing.  They seemed so happy, innocent and utterly unaware of the world.  One of them recognised us, came smiling and we walked hand in hand for some time.  Neither of us said a word and as we came near her house she saluted and disappeared inside.  The world and the family are going to destroy her and she will have children too, cry over them and in the cunning ways of the world they will be destroyed.  But that evening she was happy and eager to share it by holding a hand.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When the rains had gone, returning on the same road one evening when the western sky was golden, one passed a young man carrying a fire in an earthenware pot.  He was bare except for his clean loin cloth and behind him two men were carrying a dead body.  All were Brahmins, freshly washed, clean, holding themselves upright.  The young man carrying the fire must have been the son of the dead man: they were all walking quite fast.  The body was going to be cremated on some secluded sands.  It was all so simple, unlike the elaborate hearse, loaded with flowers, followed by a long line of polished cars or mourners walking behind the coffin: the dark blackness of it all. Or you saw a dead body, decently covered, being carried at the back of a bicycle to the sacred river to be burnt.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Death is everywhere and we never seem to live with it.  It is a dark, frightening thing to be avoided, never to be talked of.  Keep it away from the closed door.  But it is always there.  The beauty of love is death and one knows neither.  Death is pain and love is pleasure and the two can never meet; they must be kept apart and the division is the pain and agony.  This has been from the beginning of time, the division and the endless conflict.  There will always be death for those who do not see that the observer is the observed, the experiencer is the experienced.  It is like a vast river in which man is caught, with all his worldly goods, his vanities, pains and knowledge.  Unless he leaves all the things he has accumulated in the river and swims ashore, death will be always at his door, waiting and watching.  When he leaves the river there is no shore, the bank is the word, the observer.  He has left everything, the river and the bank.  For the river is time and the banks are the thoughts of time: the river is the movement of time and thought is of it.  When the observer leaves everything which he is, then the observer is not. This is not death.  It is the timeless.  You cannot know it, for what is known is of time; you cannot experience it: recognition is made up of time.  Freedom from the known is freedom from time.  Immortality is not the word, the book, the image, you have put together.  The soul, the "me", the atman is the child of thought which is time. When time is not then death is not.  Love is.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The western sky had lost its colour and just over the horizon was the new moon, young, shy and tender.  On the road everything seemed to be passing, marriage, death, the laughter of children and someone sobbing.  Near the moon was a single star. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
