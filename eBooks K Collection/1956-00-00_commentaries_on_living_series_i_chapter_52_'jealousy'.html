<FONT size=5 color=black><B>COMMENTARIES ON LIVING SERIES I CHAPTER 52 'JEALOUSY'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>THE SUN WAS bright on the white wall opposite, and its glare made the faces obscure.  A little child, without the prompting of the mother, came and sat close by, wide-eyed and wondering what it was all about.  She was freshly washed and clothed and had some flowers in her hair.  She was keenly observing everything, as children do, without recording too much.  Her eyes were sparkling, and she did not quite know what to do, whether to cry, to laugh or to jump; instead, she took my hand and looked at it with absorbing interest.  Presently she forgot all those people in the room, relaxed and went to sleep with her head in my lap.  Her head was of good shape and well balanced; she was spotlessly clean.  Her future was as confused and as miserable as that of the others in the room.  Her conflict and sorrow were as inevitable as that sun on the wall; for to be free of pain and misery needs supreme intelligence, and her education and the influences about her would see to it that she was denied this intelligence.  Love is so rare in this world, that flame without smoke; the smoke is overpowering, all-suffocating, bringing anguish and tears.  Through the smoke, the flame is rarely seen; and when the smoke becomes all-important, the flame dies.  Without that flame of love, life has no meaning, it becomes dull and weary; but the flame cannot be in the darkening smoke.  The two cannot exist together; the smoke must cease for the clear flame to be.  The flame is not a rival of the smoke; it has no rival.  The smoke is not the flame, it cannot contain the flame; nor does the smoke indicate the presence of the flame, for the flame is free of smoke.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Cannot love and hate exist together?  Is not jealousy an indication of love?  We hold hands, and then the next minute scold; we say hard things, but soon embrace.  We quarrel, then kiss and are reconciled.  Is not all this love?  The very expression of jealousy is an indication of love; they seem to go together, like light and darkness.  The swift anger and the caress - are these not the fullness of love?  The river is both turbulent and calm; it flows through shadow and sunlight, and therein lies the beauty of the river."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What is it that we call love?  It is this whole field of jealousy, of lust, of harsh words, of caress, of holding hands, of quarrelling and making up.  These are the facts in this field of so-called love.  Anger and caress are everyday facts in this field, are they not?  And we try to establish a relationship between the various facts, or we compare one fact with another.  We use one fact to condemn or justify another within this same field, or we try to establish a relationship between a fact within the field and something outside of it.  We do not take each fact separately, but try to find an interrelationship between them.  Why do we do this? We can understand a fact only when we do not use another fact in the same field as a medium of understanding, which merely creates conflict and confusion.  But why do we compare the various facts in the same field?  Why do we carry over the significance of one fact to offset or to explain another?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I am beginning to grasp what you mean.  But why do we do this?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Do we understand a fact through the screen of idea, through the screen of memory?  Do I understand jealousy because I have held your hand?  The holding of the hand is a fact, as jealousy is a fact; but do I understand the process of jealousy because I have a remembrance of holding your hand?  Is memory an aid to understanding?  Memory compares, modifies, condemns, justifies, or identifies; but it cannot bring understanding.  We approach the facts in the field of so-called love with idea, with conclusion.  We do not take the fact of jealousy as it is and silently observe it, but we want to twist the fact according to the pattern, to the conclusion; and we approach it in this way because we really do not wish to understand the fact of jealousy.  The sensations of jealousy are as stimulating as a caress; but we want stimulation without the pain and discomfort that invariably go with it.  So there is conflict, confusion and antagonism within this field which we call love.  But is it love?  Is love an idea, a sensation, a stimulation?  Is love jealousy? "Is not reality held in illusion?  Does not darkness encompass or hide light?  Is not God held in bondage?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These are mere ideas, opinions, and so they have no validity. Such ideas only breed enmity, they do not cover or hold reality. Where there is light, darkness is not.  Darkness cannot conceal light; if it does, there is no light.  Where jealousy is, love is not.  Idea cannot cover love.  To commune, there must be relationship.  Love is not related to idea, and so idea cannot commune with love.  Love is a flame without smoke. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
