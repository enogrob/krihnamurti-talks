<FONT size=5 color=black><B>LETTERS TO SCHOOLS VOLUME ONE 15TH SEPTEMBER, 1978</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>Goodness can flower only in freedom.  It cannot bloom in the soil of persuasion in any form, nor under compulsion, nor is it the outcome of reward.  It does not reveal itself when there is any kind of imitation or conformity, and naturally it cannot exist when there is fear.  Goodness shows itself in behaviour and this behaviour is based on sensitivity.  This goodness is expressed in action.  The whole movement of thought is not goodness.  Thought, which is so very complex, must be understood, but the very understanding of it awakens thought to its own limitation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goodness has no opposite.  Most of us consider goodness as the opposite of the bad or evil and so throughout history in any culture goodness has been considered the other face of that which is brutal. So man has always struggled against evil in order to be good; but goodness can never come into being if there is any form of violence or struggle.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goodness shows itself in behaviour and action and in relationship.  Generally our daily behaviour is based on either the following of certain patterns - mechanical and therefore superficial - or according to very carefully thought-out motive, based on reward or punishment.  So our behaviour, consciously or unconsciously, is calculated.  This is not good behaviour.  When one realizes this, not merely intellectually or by putting words together, then out of this total negation comes true behaviour.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Good behaviour is in essence the absence of the self, the me.  It shows itself in politeness, in consideration for others, yielding without losing integrity.  So behaviour becomes extraordinarily important.  It is not a casual affair to be slurred over or a plaything of a sophisticated mind.  It comes out of the depth of your being and is part of your daily existence.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goodness shows itself in action.  We must differentiate between action and behaviour.  Probably they are both the same thing but for clarity they must be separated and examined.  To act correctly is one of the most difficult things to do.  It is very complex and must be examined very closely without impatience or jumping to any conclusion.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In our daily lives action is a continuous movement from the past, broken up occasionally with a new set of conclusions; these conclusions then become the past and one acts accordingly.  One acts according to preconceived ideas or ideals, so one is acting always from either accumulated knowledge, which is the past, or from an idealistic future, a utopia.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We accept such action as normal.  Is it?  We question it after it has taken place or before doing it but this questioning is based on previous conclusions or future reward or punishment.  If I do this - I will get that, and so on.  So we are now questioning the whole accepted idea of action.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Action takes place after having accumulated knowledge or experience; or we act and learn from that action, pleasant or unpleasant, and this learning again becomes the accumulation of knowledge.  So both actions are based on knowledge; they are not different.  Knowledge is always the past and so our actions are always mechanical.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Is there an action that is not mechanical, non-repetitive, non-routine and so without regret?  This is really important for us to understand for where there is freedom and the flowering of goodness, action can never be mechanical.  Writing is mechanical, learning a language, driving a car is mechanical; acquiring any kind of technical knowledge and acting according to that is mechanistic. Again in this mechanical activity there might be a break and in that break a new conclusion is formed which again becomes mechanical.  One must bear in mind constantly that freedom is essential for the beauty of goodness.  There is a non-mechanistic action but you have to discover it.  You cannot be told about it, you cannot be instructed in it, you cannot learn from examples, for then it becomes imitation and conformity.  Then you have lost freedom completely and there is no goodness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think that is enough in this letter, but we will continue in our next letter with the flowering of goodness in relationship. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
