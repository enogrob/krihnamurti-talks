All action is fragmentary when the content of consciousness is broken up. This activity breeds conflict, misery and confusion; then sorrow is inevitable.

From the air at that height you could see the green fields, each separate from the other in shape, size and colour.  A stream came down to meet the sea; far beyond it were the mountains, heavy with snow.  All over the earth there were large, spreading towns, villages; on the hills there were castles, churches and houses, and beyond them were the vast deserts, brown, golden and white.  Then there was the blue sea again and more land with thick forests.  The whole earth was rich and beautiful.

He walked there, hoping to meet a tiger, and he did.  The villagers had come to tell his host that a tiger had killed a young cow the previous night and would come back that night to the kill. Would they like to see it?  A platform on a tree would be built and from there one could see the big killer and also they would tie a goat to the tree to make sure that the tiger would come.  He said he wouldn't like to see a goat killed for his pleasure.  So the matter was dropped.  But late that afternoon, as the sun was behind a rolling hill, his host wished to go for a drive, hoping that they might by chance see the tiger that had killed the cow.  They drove for some miles into the forest; it became quite dark and with the headlights on they turned back.  They had given up every hope of seeing the tiger as they drove back.  But just as they turned a corner, there it was, sitting on its haunches in the middle of the road, huge, striped, its eyes bright in the headlamps.  The car stopped and it came towards them growling and the growls shook the car; it was surprisingly large and its long tail with its black tip was moving slowly from side to side.  It was annoyed.  The window was open and as it passed growling, he put out his hand to stroke this great energy of the forest, but his host hurriedly snatched his arm back, explaining later that it would have torn his arm away.  It was a magnificent animal, full of majesty and power.

Down there on that earth, there were tyrants denying freedom to man, ideologists shaping the mind of man, priests with their centuries of tradition and belief enslaving man; the politicians with their endless promises were bringing corruption and division.  Down there man is caught in endless conflict and sorrow and in the bright lights of pleasure.  It is all so utterly meaningless the pain, the labour and the words of philosophers.  Death and unhappiness and toil, man against man.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This complex variety, modified changes in the pattern of pleasure and pain, are the content of man's consciousness, shaped and conditioned by the culture in which it has been nurtured, with its religious and economic pressures.  Freedom is not within the boundaries of such a consciousness; what is accepted as freedom is in reality a prison made somewhat livable in through the growth of technology.  In this prison there are wars, made more destructive by science and profit.  Freedom doesn't lie in the change of prisons, nor in any change of gurus, with their absurd authority.  Authority does not bring the sanity of order.  On the contrary it breeds disorder and out of this soil grows authority.  Freedom is not in fragments.  A non-fragmented mind, a mind that is whole is in freedom.  It does not know it is free; what is known is within the area of time, the past through the present to the future.  All movement is time and time is not a factor of freedom.  Freedom of choice denies freedom; choice exists only where there is confusion. Clarity of perception, insight, is the freedom from the pain of choice.  Total order is the light of freedom.  This order is not the child of thought for all activity of thought is to cultivate fragmentation.  Love is not a fragment of thought, of pleasure.  The perception of this is intelligence.  Love and intelligence are inseparable and from this flows action which does not breed pain. Order is its ground. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
