<FONT size=5 color=black><B>KRISHNAMURTI'S JOURNAL BROCKWOOD PARK 14TH ENTRY 28TH SEPTEMBER 1973</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>The big black dog had just killed a goat; it had been punished severely and tied up and it was now whining and barking.  The house had a high wall around it but somehow the goat had wandered in and the dog had chased and killed it.  The owner of the house made amends with words and silver.  It was a large house with trees around it and the lawn was never completely green however much it was watered.  The sun was cruelly strong and all the flowers and bushes had to be watered twice a day; the soil was poor and the heat of the day almost withered the greenery.  But the trees had grown large and gave comforting shadows and you could sit there in the early morning when the sun was well behind the trees.  It was a good place if you wanted to sit quietly and lose yourself in meditation, but not if you wanted to daydream or lose yourself in some satisfying illusion.  It was too severe there in those shadows, too demanding, for the whole place was given over to that kind of quiet contemplation.  You could indulge in your friendly fantasies but you would soon find out that the place did not invite the images of thought.

He was sitting with a cloth over his head, weeping; his wife had just died.  He did not want to show his tears to his children; they too were crying, not quite understanding what had happened.  The mother of many children had been unwell and lately very sick; the father sat at her bedside.  He never seemed to go out, and one day, after some ceremonies, the mother was carried out.  The house had strangely become empty, without the perfume that the mother had given to it, and it was never the same again for there was sorrow in the house now.  The father knew it; the children had lost someone forever but as yet they did not know the meaning of sorrow.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is always there, you cannot just forget it, you cannot cover it up through some form of entertainment, religious or otherwise. You may run away from it but it will be there to meet you again.  You may lose yourself in some worship, prayer or in some comforting belief but it will appear again, unbidden.  The flowering of sorrow is bitterness, cynicism or some neurotic behaviour.  You may be aggressive, violent and nasty in your conduct but sorrow is where you are.  You may have power, position and the pleasures of money but it will be there in your heart, waiting and preparing.  Do what you will you cannot escape from it.  The love that you have ends in sorrow; sorrow is time, sorrow is thought.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The tree is cut down and you shed a tear; an animal is killed for your taste; the earth is being destroyed for your pleasure; you are being educated to kill, to destroy, man against man.  The new technology and machines are taking over the toil of man but you may not end sorrow through the things that thought has put together. Love is not pleasure.

She came desperate in her sorrow; she talked, pouring out all the things she had been through, death, the inanities of her children, their politics, their divorces, their frustrations, bitterness and the utter futility of all life that had no meaning.  She was not young any more; in her youth she had just enjoyed herself, had a passing interest in politics, a degree in economics and more or less the kind of life that almost everyone leads.  Her husband had died recently and all sorrow seemed to descend upon her.  She became quiet as we talked.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Any movement of thought is the deepening of sorrow.  Thought with its memories, with its images of pleasure and pain, with its loneliness and tears, with its self-pity and remorse, is the ground of sorrow.  Listen to what is being said.  Just listen not to the echoes of the past, to the overcoming of sorrow or how to escape from its torture but listen with your heart, with your whole being to what is now being said.  Your dependence and attachment have prepared the soil for your sorrow.  Your neglect of the study of yourself and the beauty it brings, have given nourishment to your sorrow; all your self-centred activities have led you to this sorrow.  lust listen to what is being said: stay with it, don't wander off.  Any movement of thought is the strengthening of sorrow.  Thought is not love.  Love has no sorrow. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
