In its solitude it dominates the noisy stream, the hills and the cottage across the wooden bridge.  You admire it as you pass it by but on your return you look at it in a more leisurely way; its trunk is very large, deeply embedded in the earth, solid and indestructible; Its branches are long, dark and curving; it has rich shadows.  In the evening it is withdrawn into itself, unapproachable, but during the daylight hours it is open and welcoming.  It is whole, untouched by an axe or saw.  On a sunny day you sat under it, you felt its venerable age, and because you were alone-with it you were aware of the depth and the beauty of life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The old villager wearily passed you by, as you were sitting on a bridge looking at the sunset; he was almost blind, limping, carrying a bundle in one hand and in the other a stick.  It was one of those evenings when the colours of the sunset were on every rock, tree and bush; the grass and the fields seemed to have their own inner light. The sun had set behind a rounded hill and amidst these extravagant colours there was the birth of the evening star The villager stopped in front of you, looked at those startling colours and at you.  You looked at each other and without a word he trudged on.  In that communication there was affection, tenderness and respect, not the silly respect but that of religious men.  At that moment all time and thought had come to an end.  You and he were utterly religious, uncorrupted by belief, image, by word or poverty.  You often passed each other on that road among the stony hills and each time, as you looked at one another, there was the joy of total insight.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He was coming, with his wife, from the temple across the way. They were both silent, deeply stirred by the chants and the worship. You happened to be walking behind them and you caught the feeling of their reverence, the strength of their determination to lead a religious life.  But it would soon pass away as they were drawn into their responsibility to their children, who came rushing towards them.  He had some kind of profession, was probably capable, for he had a large house.  The weight of existence would drown him and although he would go to the temple often, the battle would go on.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The word is not the thing; the image, the symbol is not the real Reality, truth, is not a word.  To put it into words wipes it away and illusion takes its place.  The intellect may reject the whole structure of ideology, belief and all the trappings and power that go with them, but reason can justify any belief, any ideation.  Reason is the order of thought and thought is the response of the outer. Because it is the outer, thought puts together the inner.  No man can ever live only with the outer, and the inner becomes a necessity. This division is the ground on which the battle of "me" and "not me" takes place.  The outer is the god of religions and ideologies; the inner tries to conform to those images and conflict ensues.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is neither the outer nor the inner but only the whole.  The experiencer is the experienced.  Fragmentation is insanity.  This wholeness is not merely a word; it is when the division as the outer and inner utterly ceases.  The thinker is the thought.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Suddenly, as you were walking along, without a single thought but only observing without the observer, you became aware of a sacredness that thought has never been able to conceive.  You stop, you observe the trees, the birds and the passer-by; it is not an illusion or something with which the mind deludes itself.  It is there in your eyes, in your whole being.  The colour of the butterfly is the butterfly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The colours which the sun had left were fading, and before dark the shy new moon showed itself before it disappeared behind the hill. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
