<FONT size=5 color=black><B>LETTERS TO THE SCHOOLS VOLUME 2</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>These letters are not meant to be read casually when you have a little time from other things, nor are they to be treated as entertainment.  These letters are written seriously and if you care to read them, read them with intent to study what is said as you would study a flower by looking at the flower very carefully its petals, its stem, its colours, its fragrance and its beauty.  These letters should be studied in the same manner, not read one morning and forgotten in the rest of the day.  One must give time to it, play with it, question it, enquire into it without acceptance; live with it for some time; digest it so that it is yours and not the writer's.
