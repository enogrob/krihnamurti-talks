<FONT size=5 color=black><B>MADRAS 26TH GROUP DISCUSSION 18TH DECEMBER, 1947</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>On the last occasion, we found that the conflict of the opposites is really fallacious, because the opposite is the non-existent, which has been created from 'what is';  and that the becoming into something other than 'what is' is the oppo- site;  we also discussed the whole significance of terming a feeling, the reaction to a challenge, and that from that naming there are a series of reactions and in these reactions we get lost.  So, the becoming is the conflict.  Then the naming of the feeling is perhaps wrong because the feeling is new but it is put in the framework of references, thereby interpreting the new feeling through the framework of old references and therefore misinterpreting the feeling.  If I had not termed it perhaps I would have a different reaction to the feeling, and the feeling may then subside.  A feeling which is termed, whether unpleasant or pleasant, can come to an end if you do not name it, then you will see that it withers away.  But, is love a feeling which, when not named, will come to an end? We have discussed further about terming a feeling and what effect it has in our daily life.  We also discussed about property and what happens if we do not name it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Then the discussion went back to the question of belief, ceremonies, etc., which had already been discussed in detail, as these questions were brought up again by someone present.) </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
