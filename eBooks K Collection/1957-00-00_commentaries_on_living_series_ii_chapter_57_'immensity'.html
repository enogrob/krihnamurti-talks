<FONT size=5 color=black><B>COMMENTARIES ON LIVING SERIES II CHAPTER 57 'IMMENSITY'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>THE VALLEY LAY far below and was filled with the activity of most valleys.  The sun was just setting behind the distant mountains, and the shadows were dark and long.  It was a quiet evening, with a breeze coming off the sea.  The orange trees, row upon row, were almost black, and on the long straight road that ran through the valley there were occasional glints as moving cars caught the light of the setting sun.  It was an evening of enchantment and peace.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The mind seemed to cover the vast space and the unending distance; or rather, the mind seemed to expand without an end, and behind and beyond the mind there was something that held all things in it.  The mind vaguely struggled to recognize and remember that which was not of itself, and so it stopped its usual activity; but it could not grasp what was not of its own nature, and presently all things, including the mind were enfolded in that immensity.  The evening darkened, and the distant barking of dogs in no way disturbed that which is beyond all consciousness.  It cannot be thought about and so experienced by the mind. But what is it, then, that has perceived and is aware of something totally different from the projections of the mind?  Who is it that experiences it?  Obviously it is not the mind of everyday memories, responses and urges.  Is there another mind, or is there a part of the mind which is dormant, to be awakened only by that which is above and beyond all mind?  If this is so, then within the mind there is always that which is beyond all thought and time.  And yet this cannot be, for it is only speculative thought and therefore another of the many inventions of the mind.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since that immensity is not born of the process of the mind, then what is it that is aware of it?  Is the mind as the experiencer aware of it, or is that immensity aware of itself because there is no experiencer at all?  There was no experiencer when this happened coming down the mountain, and yet the awareness of the mind was wholly different, in kind as well as in degree, from that which is not measurable.  The mind was not functioning; it was alert and passive, and though cognizant of the breeze playing among the leaves, there was no movement of any kind within itself.  There was no observer who measured the observed.  There was only that, and that was aware of itself without measure.  It had no beginning and no word.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The mind is aware that it cannot capture by experience and word that which ever abides, timeless and immeasurable. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
