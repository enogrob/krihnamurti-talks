<FONT size=5 color=black><B>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 47TH QUESTION BROCKWOOD PARK 2ND QUESTION & ANSWER MEETING 4TH SEPTEMBER 1980 'A MINORITY'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>Question: You say, "We are the world", but the majority of the world seem to be heading for mass destruction.  Can a minority of integrated people outweigh the majority?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Are you, are we, that minority?  Is there one among us who is totally free of all this?  Or are we partially contributing to the hatred of each other, psychologically?  You may not be able to stop one country attacking another, but psychologically, are you free of your common inheritance, which is your tribal glorified nationalism? Are we free from violence?  Violence exists where there is a wall around ourselves.  Do please understand all this.  And we have built ourselves walls, fifteen feet high and ten feet thick.  All of us have these walls around us.  From that arises violence and this sense of immense loneliness.  So the minority and the majority are you.  If a group of us have psychologically transformed ourselves fundamentally we will never ask this question, because we are then something entirely different. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
