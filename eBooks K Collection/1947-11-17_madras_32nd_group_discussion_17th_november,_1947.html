<FONT size=5 color=black><B>MADRAS 32ND GROUP DISCUSSION 17TH NOVEMBER, 1947</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>My purpose in discussing various subjects with you is to awaken intelligence in you so that at least some could understand the end-purpose of life and who would devote their lives to seek Reality and keep the flame bright even in my absence.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You say that, so far, none of those who have discussed with me, has given up things like motor cars or bank balances, and that a start should be made now by giving up at least really unimportant things like the motor car, so that step by step you would be able to overcome greed.  It is not 'practice' or 'progress step by step', which will lead to the cessation of greed.  Mortification of the flesh will not lead to it;  nor will substitution of one kind by another, nor the interpretation, in the light of past experience, of a new desire for the things of life which have not been experienced before, will lead to the cessation of greed.  Greed will cease instantaneously when you have a clear understanding of its true nature. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
