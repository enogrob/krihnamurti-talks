<FONT size=5 color=black><B>COMMENTARIES ON LIVING SERIES I CHAPTER 53 'SPONTANEITY'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>SHE WAS AMONG a group of people who had come to discuss some serious matter.  She must have come out of curiosity, or was brought along by a friend.  Well dressed, she held herself with some dignity, and she evidently considered herself very good looking.  She was completely self-conscious: conscious of her body, of her looks, of her hair and the impression she was making on others.  Her gestures were studied, and from time to time she took different attitudes which she must have thought out with great care.  Her whole appearance had about it the air of a long cultivated pose into which she was determined to fit, whatever might happen.  The others began to talk of serious things, and during the whole hour or more she maintained her pose.  One saw among all those serious and intent faces this self-conscious girl, trying to follow what was being said and to join in the discussion; but no words came out of her.  She wanted to show that she too was aware of the problem that was being discussed; but there was bewilderment in her eyes, for she was incapable of taking part in the serious conversation.  One saw her quickly withdraw into herself, still maintaining the long-cultivated pose.  All spontaneity was being sedulously destroyed,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each one cultivates a pose.  There is the walk and the pose of a prosperous business man, the smile of one who has arrived; there is the look and the pose of an artist; there is the pose of a respectful disciple, and the pose of a disciplined ascetic.  Like that self-conscious girl, the so-called religious man assumes a pose, the pose of self-discipline which he has sedulously cultivated through denials and sacrifices.  She sacrifices spontaneity for effect, and he immolates himself to achieve an end.  Both are concerned with a result, though at different levels; and while his result may be considered socially more beneficial than hers, fundamentally they are similar, one is not superior to the other. Both are unintelligent, for both indicate pettiness of mind.  A petty mind is always petty; it cannot be made rich, abundant.  Though such a mind may adorn itself or seek to acquire virtue, it remains what it is, a petty, shallow thing, and through so-called growth, experience, it can only be enriched in its own pettiness.  An ugly thing cannot be made beautiful.  The god of a petty mind is a petty god.  A shallow mind does not become fathomless by adorning itself with knowledge and clever phrases, by quoting words of wisdom, or by decorating its outward appearance.  Adornments, whether inward or outward, do not make a fathomless mind; and it is this fathomlessness of the mind that gives beauty, not the jewel or the acquired virtue. For beauty to come into being, the mind must be choicelessly aware of its own pettiness; there must be an awareness in which comparison has wholly ceased.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The cultivated pose of the girl, and the disciplined pose of the so-called religious ascetic, are equally the tortured results of a petty mind, for both deny essential spontaneity.  Both are fearful of the spontaneous, for it reveals them as they are, to themselves and to others; both are bent on destroying it, and the measure of their success is the completeness of their conformity to a chosen pattern or conclusion.  But spontaneity is the only key that opens the door to what is.  The spontaneous response uncovers the mind as it is; but what is discovered is immediately adorned or destroyed, and so spontaneity is put an end to.  The killing of spontaneity is the way of a petty mind, which then decorates the outer, at whatever level; and this decoration is the worship of itself.  Only in spontaneity, in freedom, can there be discovery.  A disciplined mind cannot discover; it may function effectively and hence ruthlessly, but it cannot uncover the fathomless.  It is fear that creates the resistance called discipline; but the spontaneous discovery of fear is freedom from fear.  Conformity to a pattern, at whatever level, is fear, which only breeds conflict confusion and antagonism; but a mind that is in revolt is not fearless, for the opposite can never know the spontaneous, the free.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Without spontaneity, there can be no self-knowledge; without self-knowledge, the mind is shaped by passing influences.  These passing influences can make the mind narrow or expansive, but it is still within the sphere of influence.  What is put together can be unmade, and that which is not put together can be known only through self-knowledge.  The self is put together, and it is only in undoing the self that that which is not the result of influence, which has no cause, can be known. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
