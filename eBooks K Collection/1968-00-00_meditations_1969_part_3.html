<FONT size=5 color=black><B>MEDITATIONS 1969 PART 3</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>When you turn your head from horizon to horizon your eyes see a vast space in which all the things of the earth and of the sky appear.  But this space is always limited where the earth meets the sky.  The space in the mind is so small.  In this little space all our activities seem to take place: the daily living and the hidden struggles with contradictory desires and motives.  In this little space the mind seeks freedom, and so it is always a prisoner of itself.  Meditation is the ending of this little space.  To us, action is bringing about order in this little space of the mind.  But there is another action which is not putting order in this little space.  Meditation is action which comes when the mind has lost its little space.  This vast space which the mind, the I, cannot reach, is silence.  The mind can never be silent within itself; it is silent only within the vast space which thought cannot touch.  Out of this silence there is action which is not of thought.  Meditation is this silence. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
