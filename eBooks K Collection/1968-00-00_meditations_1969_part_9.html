<FONT size=5 color=black><B>MEDITATIONS 1969 PART 9</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>That morning the sea was like a lake or an enormous river without a ripple, and so calm that you could see the reflections of the stars so early in the morning.  The dawn had not yet come, and so the stars, and the reflection of the cliff, and the distant lights of the town, were there on the water.  And as the sun came up over the horizon in a cloudless sky it made a golden path, and it was extraordinary to see that light of California filling the earth and every leaf and blade of grass.  As you watched, a great stillness came into you.  The brain itself became very quiet, without any reaction, without a movement, and it was strange to feel this immense stillness.  "Feel" isn't the word.  The quality of that silence, that stillness, is not felt by the brain; it is beyond the brain.  The brain can conceive, formulate or make a design for the future, but this stillness is beyond its range, beyond all imagination, beyond all desire.  You are so still that your body becomes completely part of the earth, part of everything that is still.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And as the slight breeze came from the hills, stirring the leaves, this stillness, this extraordinary quality of silence, was not disturbed.  The house was between the hills and the sea, over- looking the sea.  And as you watched the sea, so very still you really became part of everything.  You were everything.  You were the light, and the beauty of love.  Again, to say "you were a part of everything" is also wrong: the word "you" is not adequate because you really weren't there.  You didn't exist.  There was only that stillness, the beauty, the extraordinary sense of love.  The words you and I separate things.  This division in this strange silence and stillness doesn't exist.  And as you watched out of the window, space and time seemed to have come to an end, and the space that divides had no reality.  That leaf and that eucalyptus and the blue shining water were not different from you.

Meditation is really very simple.  We complicate it.  We weave a web of ideas round it what it is and what it is not.  But it is none of these things.  Because it is so very simple it escapes us, because our minds are so complicated, so time-worn and time-based.  And this mind dictates the activity of the heart, and then the trouble begins. But meditation comes naturally, with extraordinary ease, when you walk on the sand or look out of your window or see those marvellous hills burnt by last summer's sun.  Why are we such tortured human beings, with tears in our eyes and false laughter on our lips?  If you could walk alone among those hills or in the woods or along the long, white, bleached sands, in that solitude you would know what meditation is.  The ecstasy of solitude comes when you are not frightened to be alone no longer belonging to the world or attached to anything.  Then, like that dawn that came up this morning, it comes silently, and makes a golden path in the very stillness, which was at the beginning, which is now, and which will be always there. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
