<FONT size=5 color=black><B>MADRAS 4TH GROUP DISCUSSION 28TH OCTOBER, 1947</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>We discovered that any form of conclusion, right or wrong, immediate or ultimate, now or final, or any form of working hypothesis consciously or unconsciously held, is detrimental to full comprehension or understanding of the whole process of existence.  Hindrances are not overcome or broken;  but when the mind becomes aware of the hindrances, those hindrances cease to be.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What is awareness?  There is objective awareness.  Then, there is the emotional response to each other or to truth.  Then, there is awareness of ideas, of thinking, conscious or unconscious.  It is a widening and deepening grasp of both the conscious and unconscious.  It is a clear recognition of what is, not what should be or what, ideologically, should take place.  To be aware implies to recognize and to know fully and clearly how the "I" is moving, living and functioning - physically, psychologically, consciously or unconsciously.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Experience and experiencer, thinker and his thoughts, are the same. For example, at the moment of anger, the person who feels angry and his quality of anger are the same.  Just afterwards the thinker separates himself from the quality and condemns the quality if unpleasant or identifies himself with the quality if pleasant.  This is because the thinker seeks stability or permanency.  When this is understood by the mind, this duality is dissolved. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
