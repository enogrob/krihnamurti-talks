<FONT size=5 color=black><B>FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT PREFACE</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>The Collected Works of J. Krishnamurti, of which this volume is the first, is a true record for posterity of the works of this unique human being whose message represents no known organized religion, philosophy or ideology.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
History has often revealed that the life and experiences of a single human being can be of an unusual character from beginning to end and can have a significant influence on the lives of many others all over the earth.  This is especially so if that person is unique as a thinker and teacher endeavoring to communicate the truth and meaning of human experiences that reach to the deepest level in all of us, as he has discovered them on his journey in search of the truth about life and living.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the life of such a being, as in the lives of many artists, there can be different creative periods, arising out of the experiences of a particular time.  These may seem to differ widely in expression but are actually rooted in the same inward creative source, reflecting different insights at different periods of life. Some readers will find this to be true of these teachings and writings of J.  Krishnamurti that have been published before over a period of sixty years in various parts of the world.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During the more than half a century that Krishnamurti has been a public figure, travelling continually about the world, his message has been heard and read assiduously by thousands of people of all ages who have come to realize that the traditional religious, moral and ethical values have failed to bring about a peaceful and happy social order.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Krishnamurti has provided us with a living restatement of truth, love and beauty - the fundamental essence of the truly religious life, a life free of superstition, greed and fear - which is the only source and foundation of lasting happiness for the individual and for peace and order in our world.
