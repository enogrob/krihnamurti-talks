<FONT size=5 color=black><B>COMMENTARIES ON LIVING SERIES I CHAPTER 30 'ANGER'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>EVEN AT THAT altitude the heat was penetrating.  The windowpanes felt warm to the touch.  The steady hum of the plane's motor was soothing, and many of the passengers were dozing.  The earth was far below us, shimmering in the heat, an unending brown with an occasional patch of green.  Presently we landed, and the heat became all but unbearable; it was literally painful, and even in the shade of a building the top of one's head felt as if it would burst.  The summer was well along and the country was almost a desert.  We took off again and the plane climbed, seeking the cool winds.  Two new passengers sat in the opposite seats and they were talking loudly; it was impossible not to overhear them.  They began quietly enough; but soon anger crept into their voices, the anger of familiarity and resentment.  In their violence they seemed to have forgotten the rest of the passengers; they were so upset with each other that they alone existed, and none else.

Anger has that peculiar quality of isolation; like sorrow, it cuts one off, and for the time being, at least, all relationship comes to an end.  Anger has the temporary strength and vitality of the isolated.  There is a strange despair in anger; for isolation is despair.  The anger of disappointment, of jealousy, of the urge to wound, gives a violent release whose pleasure is self-justification. We condemn others, and that very condemnation is a justification of ourselves.  Without some kind of attitude, whether of self-righteousness or self-abasement, what are we?  We use every means to bolster ourselves up; and anger, like hate, is one of the easiest ways.  Simple anger, a sudden flare-up which is quickly forgotten, is one thing; but the anger that is deliberately built up, that has been brewed and that seeks to hurt and destroy, is quite another matter.  Simple anger may have some physiological cause which can be seen and remedied; but the anger that is the outcome of a psychological cause is much more subtle and difficult to deal with. Most of us do not mind being angry, we find an excuse for it.  Why should we not be angry when there is ill-treatment of another or of ourselves? So we become righteously angry.  We never just say we are angry, and stop there; we go into elaborate explanations of its cause.  We never just say that we are jealous or bitter, but justify or explain it. We ask how there can be love without jealousy, or say that someone else's actions have made us bitter, and so on.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is the explanation, the verbalization, whether silent or spoken, that sustains anger, that gives it scope and depth.  The explanation silent or spoken, acts as a shield against the discovery of ourselves as we are.  We want to be praised or flattered, we expect something; and when these things do not take place, we are disappointed, we become bitter or jealous.  Then, violently or softly, we blame someone else; we say the other is responsible for our bitterness.  You are of great significance because I depend upon you for my happiness, for my position or prestige.  Through you, I fulfil, so you are important to me; I must guard you, I must possess you.  Through you, I escape from myself; and when I am thrown back upon myself, being fearful of my own state, I become angry.  Anger takes many forms: disappointment, resentment, bitterness, jealousy, and so on.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The storing up of anger, which is resentment, requires the antidote of forgiveness; but the storing up of anger is far more significant than forgiveness.  Forgiveness is unnecessary when there is no accumulation of anger.  Forgiveness is essential if there is resentment; but to be free from flattery and from the sense of injury, without the hardness of indifference, makes for mercy, charity.  Anger cannot be got rid of by the action of will, for will is part of violence.  Will is the outcome of desire, the craving to lie; and desire in its very nature is aggressive, dominant.  To suppress anger by the exertion of will is to transfer anger to a different level, giving it a different name; but it is still part of violence.  To be free from violence, which is not the cultivation of non-violence, there must be the understanding of desire.  There is no spiritual substitute for desire; it cannot be suppressed or sublimated.  There must be a silent and choiceless awareness of desire; and this passive awareness is the direct experiencing of desire without an experiencer giving it a name. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
