<FONT size=5 color=black><B>MEDITATIONS 1969 PART 6</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>After the rains the hills were splendid.  They were still brown from the summer sun, and now all the green things would come out.  It had rained quite heavily, and the beauty of those hills was indescribable.  The sky was still clouded and in the air there was the smell of sumac, sage and eucalyptus.  It was splendid to be among them, and a strange stillness possessed you.  Unlike the sea which lay far down below you, those hills were completely still.  As you watched and looked about you, you had left everything down below in that little house your clothes, your thoughts and the odd ways of life.  Here you were travelling very lightly, without any thoughts, without any burden, and with a feeling of complete emptiness and beauty.  The little green bushes would soon be still greener, and in a few weeks' time they would have a stronger smell.  The quails were calling and a few of them flew over.  Without knowing it, the mind was in a state of meditation in which love was flowering.  After all, only in the soil of meditation can this flower bloom.  It was really quite marvellous, and strangely, all through the night it pursued you, and when you woke, long before the sun was up, it was still there in your heart with its incredible joy, for no reason whatsoever.  It was there, causeless, and was quite intoxicating.  It would be there all through the day without your ever asking or inviting it to stay with you. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
