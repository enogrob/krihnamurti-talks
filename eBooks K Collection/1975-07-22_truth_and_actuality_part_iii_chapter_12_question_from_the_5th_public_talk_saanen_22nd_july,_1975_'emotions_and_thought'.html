<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Krishnamurti: What are emotions?  Emotions are sensations, aren't they?  You see a lovely car, or a beautiful house, a beautiful woman or man, and the sensory perception awakens the senses.  Then what takes place?  Contact, then desire, Now thought comes in.  Can you end there and not let thought come in and take over?  I see a beautiful house, the right proportions, with a lovely lawn, a nice garden: all the senses are responding because there is great beauty - it is well kept, orderly, tidy.  Why can't you stop there and not let thought come in and say, "I must have" and all the rest of it?  Then you will see emotions, or sensations, are natural, healthy, normal. But when thought takes over, then all the mischief begins.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So to find out for oneself whether it is possible to look at something with all the senses and end there and not proceed further - do it!  That requires an extraordinary sense of awareness in which there is no control; no control, therefore no conflict.  Just to observe totally that which is, and all the senses respond and end there.  There is great beauty in that.  For after all what is beauty? </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
