<FONT size=5 color=black><B>MEDITATIONS 1969 PART 7</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>It had rained heavily during the night and the day, and down the gullies the muddy stream poured into the sea, making it chocolate-brown.  As you walked on the beach the waves were enormous and they were breaking with magnificent curve and force.  You walked against the wind, and suddenly you felt there was nothing between you and the sky, and this openness was heaven.  To be so completely open, vulnerable to the hills, to the sea and to man is the very essence of meditation.  To have no resistance, to have no barriers inwardly towards anything, to be really free, completely, from all the minor urges, compulsions and demands, with all their little conflicts and hypocrisies, is to walk in life with open arms.  And that evening, walking there on that wet sand, with the seagulls around you, you felt the extraordinary sense of open freedom and the great beauty of love which was not in you or outside you but everywhere.  We don't realize how important it is to be free of the nagging pleasures and their pains, so that the mind remains alone.  It is only the mind that is wholly alone that is open.  You felt all this suddenly, like a great wind that swept over the land and through you.  There you were denuded of everything, empty and therefore utterly open.  The beauty of it was not in the word or in the feeling, but seemed to be everywhere about you, inside you, over the waters and in the hills. Meditation is this. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
