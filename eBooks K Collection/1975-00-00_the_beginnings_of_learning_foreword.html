<FONT size=5 color=black><B>THE BEGINNINGS OF LEARNING FOREWORD</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>At Brockwood Park in Hampshire, England there is an Educational Centre for boys and girls aged from thirteen to nineteen. Krishnamurti lives there when he is in England.  The first part of this book gives some of the talks and discussions which take place twice a week in an informal way between Krishnamurti, students and staff.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are also schools in India founded by Krishnamurti and visited annually by him, particularly Rajghat at Benares, and Rishi Valley in the Chittoor District of Andhra Pradesh.  Many of the conversations with parents and teachers in the second part of this book took place in India.  Apart from Brockwood, others were in the United States where Krishnamurti has spoken in recent years at the University of California at Berkeley and at Santa Cruz, and at Brandeis and Stanford Universities, as well as individually with educationalist and students.  A school for young children is shortly to be opened in the Ojai Valley in California.
