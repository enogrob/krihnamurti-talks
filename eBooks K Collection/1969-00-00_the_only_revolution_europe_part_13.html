<FONT size=5 color=black><B>THE ONLY REVOLUTION EUROPE PART 13</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>To meditate is to transcend time.  Time is the distance that thought travels in its achievements.  The travelling is always along the old path covered over with a new coating, new sights, but always the same road, leading nowhere except to pain and sorrow.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is only when the mind transcends time that truth ceases to be an abstraction.  Then bliss is not an idea derived from pleasure but an actuality that is not verbal.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The emptying of the mind of time is the silence of truth, and the seeing of this is the doing; so there is no division between the seeing and the doing.  In the interval between seeing and doing is born conflict, misery and confusion.  That which has no time is the everlasting.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On every table there were daffodils, young, fresh, just out of the garden, with the bloom of spring on them still.  On a side table there were lilies, creamy-white with sharp yellow centres.  To see this creamy-white and the brilliant yellow of those many daffodils was to see the blue sky, ever expanding, limitless, silent.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Almost all the tables were taken by people talking very loudly and laughing.  At a table nearby a woman was surreptitiously feeding her dog with the meat she could not eat.  They all seemed to have huge helpings, and it was not a pleasant sight to see people eating; perhaps it may be barbarous to eat publicly.  A man across the room had filled himself with wine and meat and was just lighting a big cigar, and a look of beatitude came over his fat face.  His equally fat wife lit a cigarette.  Both of them appeared to be lost to the world.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And there they were, the yellow daffodils, and nobody seemed to care.  They were there for decorative purposes that had no meaning at all; and as you watched them their yellow brilliance filled the noisy room.  Colour has this strange effect upon the eye.  It wasn't so much that the eye absorbed the colour, as that the colour seemed to fill your being.  You were that colour; you didn't become that colour - you were of it, without identification or name: the anonymity which is innocence.  Where there is no anonymity there is violence, in all its different forms.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But you forgot the world, the smoke-filled room, the cruelty of man, and the red, ugly meat; those shapely daffodils seemed to take you beyond all time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Love is like that.  In it there is no time, space or identity. It is the identity that breeds pleasure and pain; it is the identity that brings hate and war and builds a wall around people, around each one, each family and community.  Man reaches over the wall to the other man - but he too is enclosed; morality is a word that bridges the two, and so it becomes ugly and vain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Love isn't like that; it is like that wood across the way, always renewing itself because it is always dying.  There is no permanency in it, which thought seeks; it is a movement which thought can never understand, touch or feel.  The feeling of thought and the feeling of love are two different things; the one leads to bondage and the other to the flowering of goodness.  The flowering is not within the area of any society, of any culture or of any religion, whereas the bondage belongs to all societies, religious beliefs and faith in otherness.  Love is anonymous, therefore not violent.  Pleasure is violent, for desire and will are moving factors in it.  Love cannot be begotten by thought, or by good works.  The denial of the total process of thought becomes the beauty of action, which is love.  Without this there is no bliss of truth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And over there, on that table, were the daffodils. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
