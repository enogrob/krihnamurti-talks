<FONT size=5 color=black><B>MEDITATIONS 1969 PART 2</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>Perception without the word, which is without thought, is one of the strangest phenomena.  Then the perception is much more acute, not only with the brain, but also with all the senses.  Such perception is not the fragmentary perception of the intellect nor the affair of the emotions.  It can be called a total perception, and it is part of meditation.  Perception without the perceiver in meditation is to commune with the height and depth of the immense.  This perception is entirely different from seeing an object without an observer, because in the perception of meditation there is no object and therefore no experience.  Meditation can, however, take place when the eyes are open and one is surrounded by objects of every kind.  But then these objects have no importance at all.  One sees them but there is no process of recognition, which means there is no experiencing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What meaning has such meditation?  There is no meaning; there is no utility.  But in that meditation there is a movement of great ecstasy which is not to be confounded with pleasure.  It is this ecstasy which gives to the eye, to the brain and to the heart, the quality of innocency.  Without seeing life as something totally new, it is a routine, a boredom, a meaningless affair.  So meditation is of the greatest importance.  It opens the door to the incalculable, to the measureless. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
