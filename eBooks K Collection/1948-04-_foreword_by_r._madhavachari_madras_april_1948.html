<FONT size=5 color=black><B>FOREWORD BY R. MADHAVACHARI MADRAS APRIL 1948</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>During Krishnamurti's stay at Madras in April 1948, several persons interested in his teachings met him regularly and discussed with him various problems about Life and Reality, which affect them in their daily life, with a view to understanding those problems and discovering what they were seeking in life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These notes were prepared by me at the conclusion of each meeting. They are now published at the request of friends who consider them to be a help in understanding Krishnamurti's teachings.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These notes are not authentic, nor have they been read or revised by Krishnamurti.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
