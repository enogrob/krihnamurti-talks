<FONT size=5 color=black><B>THE URGENCY OF CHANGE 'THE RELIGIOUS LIFE'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>Questioner: I should like to know what a religious life is.  I have stayed in monasteries for several months, meditated, led a disciplined life, read a great deal.  I've been to various temples, churches and mosques.  I've tried to lead a very simple, harmless life, trying not to hurt people or animals.  This surely isn't all there is to a religious life?  I've practised yoga, studied Zen and followed many religious disciples.  I am, and have always been, a vegetarian.  As you see, I'm getting old now, and I've lived with some of the saints in different parts of the world, but somehow I feel that all this is only the outskirts of the real thing.  So I wonder if we can discuss today what to you is a religious life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Krishnamurti: A sannyasi came to see me one day and he was sad. He said he had taken a vow of celibacy and left the world to become a mendicant, wandering from village to village, but his sexual desires were so imperious that one morning he decided to have his sexual organs surgically removed.  For many months he was in constant pain, but somehow it healed, and after many years he fully realized what he had done.  And so he came to see me and in that little room he asked me what he could do now, having mutilated himself, to become normal again - not physically, of course, but inwardly.  He had done this thing because sexual activity was considered contrary to a religious life.  It was considered mundane, belonging to the world of pleasure, which a real sannyasi must at all costs avoid.  He said, "Here I am, feeling completely lost, deprived of my manhood.  I struggled so hard against my sexual desires, trying to control them, and ultimately this terrible thing took place.  Now what am I to do?  I know that what I did was wrong.  My energy has almost gone and I seem to be ending my life in darkness." He held my hand, and we sat silently for some time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Is this a religious life?  Is the denial of pleasure or beauty a way that leads to a religious life?  To deny the beauty of the skies and the hills and the human form, will that lead to a religious life? But that is what most saints and monks believe.  They torture themselves in that belief.  Can a tortured, twisted, distorted mind ever find what is a religious life?  Yet all religions assert that the only way to reality or to God, or whatever they call it, is through this torture, this distortion.  They all make the distinction between what they call a spiritual or religious life and what they call a worldly life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A man who lives only for pleasure, with occasional flashes of sorrow and piety, whose whole life is given to amusement and entertainment is, of course, a worldly man, although he may also be very clever, very scholarly, and fill his life with other people's thoughts or his own.  And a man who has a gift and exercises it for the benefit of society, or for his own pleasure, and who achieves fame in the fulfilment of that gift, such a man, surely, is also worldly.  But it is also worldly to go to church, or to the temple or the mosque, to pray, steeped in prejudice, bigotry, utterly unaware of the brutality that this implies.  It is worldly to be patriotic, nationalistic, idealistic.  The man who shuts himself up in a monastery - getting up at regular hours with a book in hand, reading and praying - is surely also worldly.  And the man who goes out to do good works, whether he is a social reformer or a missionary, is just like the politician in his concern with the world.  The division between the religious life and the world is the very essence of worldliness.  The minds of all these people - monks, saints, reformers - are not very different from the minds of those who are only concerned with the things that give pleasure.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So it is important not to divide life into the worldly and the non-worldly.  It is important not to make the distinction between the worldly and the so-called religious.  Without the world of matter, the material world, we wouldn't be here.  Without the beauty of the sky and the single tree on the hill, without that woman going by and that man riding the horse, life wouldn't be possible.  We are concerned with the totality of life not a particular part of it which is considered religious in opposition to the rest.  So one begins to see that a religious life is concerned with the whole and not with the particular.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Questioner: I understand what you say.  We have to deal with the totality of living; we can't separate the world from the so-called spirit.  So the question is: in what way can we act religiously with regard to all the things in life?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Krishnamurti: What do we mean by acting religiously?  Don't you mean a way of life in which there is no division - division between the worldly and the religious, between what should be and what shouldn't be, between me and you, between like and dislike?  This division is conflict.  A life of conflict is not a religious life.  A religious life is only possible when we deeply understand conflict. This understanding is intelligence.  It is this intelligence that acts rightly.  What most people call intelligence is merely deftness in some technical activity, or cunning in business or political chicanery. Questioner: So my question really means how is one to live without conflict, and bring about that feeling of true sanctity which is not simply emotional piety conditioned by some religious cage - no matter how old and venerated that cage is?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Krishnamurti: A man living without too much conflict in a village, or dreaming in a cave on a "sacred" hillside, is surely not living the religious life that we are talking about.  To end conflict is one of the most complex things.  It needs self-observation and the sensitivity of awareness of the outer as well as of the inner. Conflict can only end where there is the understanding of the contradiction in oneself.  This contradiction will always exist if there is no freedom from the known, which is the past.  Freedom from the past means living in the now which is not of time, in which there is only this movement of freedom, untouched by the past, by the known.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Questioner: What do you mean by freedom from the past?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Krishnamurti: The past is all our accumulated memories.  These memories act in the present and create our hopes and fears of the future.  These hopes and fears are the psychological future: without them there is no future.  So the present is the action of the past, and the mind is this movement of the past.  The past acting in the present creates what we call the future.  This response of the past is involuntary, it is not summoned or invited, it is upon us before we know it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Questioner: In that case, how are we going to be free of it?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Krishnamurti: To be aware of this movement without choice - because choice again is more of this same movement of the past - is to observe the past in action: such observation is not a movement of the past.  To observe without the image of thought is action in which the past has ended.  To observe the tree without thought is action without the past.  To observe the action of the past is again action without the past.  The state of seeing is more important than what is seen.  To be aware of the past in that choiceless observation is not only to act differently, but to be different.  In this awareness memory acts without impediment, and efficiently.  To be religious is to be so choicelessly aware that there is freedom from the known even whilst the known acts wherever it has to.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Questioner: But the known, the past, still sometimes acts even when it should not; it still acts to cause conflict.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Krishnamurti: To be aware of this is also to be in a state of inaction with regard to the past which is acting.  So freedom from the known is truly the religious life.  That doesn't mean to wipe out the known but to enter a different dimension altogether from which the known is observed.  This action of seeing choicelessly is the action of love.  The religious life is this action, and all living is this action, and the religious mind is this action.  So religion, and the mind, and life, and love, are one. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
