<FONT size=5 color=black><B>THE FIRST AND LAST FREEDOM CHAPTER 8 'CONTRADICTION'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>WE SEE CONTRADICTION in us and about us; because we are in contradiction, there is lack of peace in us and therefore outside us. There is in us a constant state of denial and assertion - what we want to be and what we are.  The state of contradiction creates conflict and this conflict does not bring about peace - which is a simple, obvious fact.  This inward contradiction should not be translated into some kind of philosophical dualism, because that is a very easy escape.  That is by saying that contradiction is a state of dualism we think we have solved it - which is obviously a mere convention, a contributory escape from actuality.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now what do we mean by conflict, by contradiction?  Why is there a contradiction in me? - this constant struggle to be something apart from what I am.  I am this, and I want to be that.  This contradiction in us is a fact, not a metaphysical dualism. Metaphysics has no significance in understanding what is.  We may discuss, say, dualism, what it is, if it exists, and so on; but of what value is it if we don't know that there is contradiction in us, opposing desires, opposing interests, opposing pursuits?  I want to be good and I am not able to be.  This contradiction, this opposition in us, must be understood because it creates conflict; and in conflict, in struggle, we cannot create individually.  Let us be clear on the state we are in.  There is contradiction, so there must be struggle; and struggle is destruction, waste.  In that state we can produce nothing but antagonism, strife, more bitterness and sorrow.  If we can understand this fully and hence be free of contradiction, then there can be inward peace, which will bring understanding of each other. The problem is this.  Seeing that conflict is destructive, wasteful, why is it that in each of us there is contradiction?  To understand that, we must go a little further.  Why is there the sense of opposing desires?  I do not know if we are aware of it in ourselves - this contradiction, this sense of wanting and not wanting, remembering something and trying to forget it in order to find something new.  Just watch it.  It is very simple and very normal.  It is not something extraordinary.  The fact is, there is contradiction.  Then why does this contradiction arise?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What do we mean by contradiction?  Does it not imply an impermanent state which is being opposed by another impermanent state?  I think I have a permanent desire, I posit in myself a permanent desire and another desire arises which contradicts it; this contradiction brings about conflict, which is waste.  That is to say there is a constant denial of one desire by another desire, one pursuit overcoming another pursuit.  Now, is there such a thing as a permanent desire ? Surely, all desire is impermanent - not metaphysically, but actually.  I want a job.  That is I look to a certain job as a means of happiness; and when I get it, I am dissatisfied.  I want to become the manager, then the owner, and so on and on, not only in this world, but in the so-called spiritual world - the teacher becoming the principal, the priest becoming the bishop, the pupil becoming the master.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This constant becoming, arriving at one state after another, brings about contradiction, does it not?  Therefore, why not look at life not as one permanent desire but as a series of fleeting desires always in opposition to each other?  Hence the mind need not be in a state of contradiction.  If I regard life not as a permanent desire but as a series of temporary desires which are constantly changing, then there is no contradiction.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Contradiction arises only when the mind has a fixed point of desire; that is when the mind does not regard all desire as moving, transient, but seizes upon one desire and makes that into a permanency - only then, when other desires arise, is there contradiction.  But all desires are in constant movement, there is no fixation of desire.  There is no fixed point in desire; but the mind establishes a fixed point because it treats everything as a means to arrive, to gain; and there must be contradiction, conflict, as long as one is arriving.  You want to arrive, you want to succeed, you want to find an ultimate God or truth which will be your permanent satisfaction.  Therefore you are not seeking truth, you are not seeking God.  You are seeking lasting gratification, and that gratification you clothe with an idea, a respectable-sounding word such as God, truth; but actually we are all seeking gratification, and we place that gratification, that satisfaction, at the highest point, calling it God, and the lowest point is drink.  So long as the mind is seeking gratification, there is not much difference between God and drink.  Socially, drink may be bad; but the inward desire for gratification, for gain, is even more harmful, is it not?  If you really want to find truth, you must be extremely honest, not merely at the verbal level but altogether; you must be extraordinarily clear, and you cannot be clear if you are unwilling to face facts.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now what brings about contradiction in each one of us?  Surely it is the desire to become something, is it not?  We all want to become something: to become successful in the world and, inwardly, to achieve a result.  So long as we think in terms of time, in terms of achievement, in terms of position, there must be contradiction. After all, the mind is the product of time.  Thought is based on yesterday, on the past; and so long as thought is functioning within the field of time, thinking in terms of the future, of becoming, gaining, achieving, there must be contradiction, because then we are incapable of facing exactly what is.  Only in realizing, in understanding, in being choicelessly aware of what is, is there a possibility of freedom from that disintegrating factor which is contradiction.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Therefore it is essential, is it not?, to understand the whole process of our thinking, for it is there that we find contradiction.  Thought itself has become a contradiction because we have not understood the total process of ourselves; and that understanding is possible only when we are fully aware of our thought, not as an observer operating upon his thought, but integrally and without choice - which is extremely arduous.  Then only is there the dissolution of that contradiction which is so detrimental, so painful.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So long as we are trying to achieve a psychological result, so long as we want inward security, there must be a contradiction in our life.  I do not think that most of us are aware of this contradiction; or, if we are, we do not see its real significance. On the contrary, contradiction gives us an impetus to live; the very element of friction makes us feel that we are alive.  The effort, the struggle of contradiction, gives us a sense of vitality.  That is why we love wars, that is why we enjoy the battle of frustrations.  So long as there is the desire to achieve a result, which is the desire to be psychologically secure, there must be a contradiction; and where there is contradiction, there cannot be a quiet mind. Quietness of mind is essential to understand the whole significance of life.  Thought can never be tranquil; thought, which is the product of time, can never find that which is timeless, can never know that which is beyond time.  The very nature of our thinking is a contradiction, because we are always thinking in terms of the past or of the future; therefore we are never fully cognizant, fully aware of the present.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To be fully aware of the present is an extraordinarily difficult task because the mind is incapable of facing a fact directly without deception.  Thought is the product of the past and therefore it can only think in terms of the past or the future; it cannot be completely aware of a fact in the present.  So long as thought, which is the product of the past, tries to eliminate contradiction and all the problems that it creates, it is merely pursuing a result, trying to achieve an end, and such thinking only creates more contradiction and hence conflict, misery and confusion in us and, therefore, about us.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To be free of contradiction, one must be aware of the present without choice.  How can there be choice when you are confronted with a fact?  Surely the understanding of the fact is made impossible so long as thought is trying to operate upon the fact in terms of becoming, changing, altering.  Therefore self-knowledge is the beginning of understanding; without self-knowledge, contradiction and conflict will continue.  To know the whole process, the totality of oneself, does not require any expert, any authority.  The pursuit of authority only breeds fear.  No expert, no specialist, can show us how to understand the process of the self.  One has to study it for oneself.  You and I can help each other by talking about it, but none can unfold it for us, no specialist, no teacher, can explore it for us.  We can be aware of it only in our relationship - in our relationship to things, to property, to people and to ideas.  In relationship we shall discover that contradiction arises when action is approximating itself to an idea.  The idea is merely the crystallization of thought as a symbol, and the effort to live up to the symbol brings about a contradiction.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thus, so long as there is a pattern of thought, contradiction will continue; to put an end to the pattern, and so to contradiction, there must be self-knowledge.  This understanding of the self is not a process reserved for the few.  The self is to be understood in our everyday speech, in the way we think and feel, in the way we look at another.  If we can be aware of every thought, of every feeling, from moment to moment, then we shall see that in relationship the ways of the self are understood.  Then only is there a possibility of that tranquillity of mind in which alone the ultimate reality can come into being. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
