<FONT size=5 color=black><B>COMMENTARIES ON LIVING SERIES I CHAPTER 49 'PROBLEMS AND ESCAPES'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>"I HAVE MANY SERIOUS problems, and I seem to make them more tortuous and painful by trying to solve them.  I am at my wit's end, and I do not know what to do.  Added to all this, I am deaf and have to use this beastly thing as an aid to my hearing.  I have several children and a husband who has left me.  I am really concerned over my children, as I want them to avoid all the miseries I have been through."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How anxious we are to find an answer to our problems!  We are so eager to find an answer that we cannot study the problem; it prevents our silent observation of the problem.  The problem is the important thing, and not the answer.  If we look for an answer, we will find it; but the problem will persist, for the answer is irrelevant to the problem.  Our search is for an escape from the problem, and the solution is a superficial remedy, so there is no understanding of the problem.  All problems arise from one source, and without understanding the source, any attempt to solve the problems will only lead to further confusion and misery.  One must first be very clear that one's intention to understand the problem is serious, that one sees the necessity of being free of all problems; for only then can the maker of problems be approached.  Without freedom from problems, there can be no tranquillity; and tranquillity is essential for happiness, which is not an end in itself.  As the pool is still when the breezes stop, so the mind is still with the cessation of problems.  But the mind cannot be made still; if it is, it is dead, it is a stagnant pool.  When this is clear, then the maker of problems can be observed.  The observation must be silent and not according to any predetermined plan based on pleasure and pain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"But you are asking the impossible!  Our education trains the mind to distinguish, to compare, to judge, to choose, and it is very difficult not to condemn or justify what is observed.  How can one be free of this conditioning and observe silently?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you see that silent observation, passive awareness is essential for understanding, then the truth of your perception liberates you from the background.  It is only when you do not see the immediate necessity of passive and yet alert awareness that the "how," the search for a means to dissolve the background, aries.  It is truth that liberates, not the means or the system.  The truth that silent observation alone brings understanding, must be seen; then only are you free from condemnation and justification.  When you see danger, you do not ask how you are to keep away from it.  It is because you do not see the necessity of being passively aware that you ask "how." Why do you not see the necessity of it?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I want to, but I have never thought along these lines before. All I can say is that I want to get rid of my problems, because they are a real torture to me.  I want to be happy, like any other person."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Consciously or unconsciously we refuse to see the essentiality of being passively aware because we do not really want to let go of our problems; for what would we be without them?  We would rather cling to something we know, however painful, than risk the pursuit of something that may lead who knows where.  With the problems, at least, we are familiar; but the thought of pursuing the maker of them, not knowing where it may lead, creates in us fear and dullness. The mind would be lost without the worry of problems; it feeds on problems, whether they are world or kitchen problems, political or personal, religious or ideological; so our problems make us petty and narrow.  A mind that is consumed with world problems is as petty as the mind that worries about the spiritual progress it is making. Problems burden the mind with fear, for problems give strength to the self, to the "me" and the "mine." Without problems, without achievements and failures, the self is not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"But without the self, how can one exist at all?  It is the source of all action."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As long as action is the outcome of desire, of memory, of fear, of pleasure and pain, it must inevitably breed conflict, confusion and antagonism.  Our action is the outcome of our conditioning, at whatever level; and our response to challenge, being inadequate and incomplete, must produce conflict, which is the problem. Conflict is the very structure of the self.  It is entirely possible to live without conflict, the conflict of greed, of fear, of success; but this possibility will be merely theoretical and not actual until it is discovered through direct experiencing.  To exist without greed is possible only when the ways of the self are understood.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Do you think my deafness is due to my fears and repressions? Doctors have assured me that there is nothing structurally wrong, and is there any possibility of recovering my hearing?  I have been suppressed, in one way or another, all my life; I have never done anything that I really wanted to do."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Inwardly and outwardly it is easier to repress than to understand.  To understand is arduous, especially for those who have been heavily conditioned from childhood.  Although strenuous, repression becomes a matter of habit.  Understanding can never be made into a habit, a matter of routine; it demands constant watchfulness, alertness.  To understand, there must be pliability, sensitivity, a warmth that has nothing to do with sentimentality. Suppression in any form needs no quickening of awareness; it is the easiest and the stupidest way to deal with responses.  Suppression is conformity to an idea, to a pattern, and it offers superficial security, respectability.  Understanding is liberating, but suppression is always narrowing, self-enclosing.  Fear of authority, of insecurity, of opinion, builds up an ideological refuge, with its physical counterpart, to which the mind turns.  This refuge, at whatever level it may be placed, ever sustains fear; and from fear there is substitution, sublimation or discipline, which are all a form of repression.  Repression must find an outlet, which may be a physical ailment or some kind of ideological illusion.  The price is paid according to one's temperament and idiosyncrasies.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I have noticed that whenever there is something unpleasant to be heard, I take refuge behind this instrument, which thereby helps me to escape into my own world.  But how is one to be free from the repression of years?  Will it not take a long time?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is not a question of time, of dredging into the past, or of careful analysis; it is a matter of seeing the truth of repression.  By being passively aware, without any choice, of the whole process of repression, the truth of it is immediately seen. The truth of repression cannot be discovered if we think in terms of yesterday and tomorrow; truth is not to be comprehended through the passage of time.  Truth is not a thing to be attained; it is seen or it is not seen, it cannot be perceived gradually.  The will to be free from repression is a hindrance to understanding the truth of it; for will is desire, whether positive or negative, and with desire there can be no passive awareness.  It is desire or craving that brought about the repression; and this same desire, though now called will, can never free itself from its own creation.  Again, the truth of will must be perceived through passive yet alert awareness.  The analyser, though he may separate himself from it, is part of the analysed; and as he is conditioned by the thing he analyses, he cannot free himself from it, again, the truth of this must be seen. It is truth that liberates, not will and effort. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
