He laughingly said that business and politics were a good combination; yet he was an earnest man in an odd, superstitious way.  Whenever he had time he would read sacred books and repeat over and over again certain words which he considered beneficial.  They brought peace to the soul, he said.  He was advanced in years and very wealthy, but he was not generous either with the hand or with the heart.  One could see that he was cunning and calculating, and yet there was an urge for something more than physical success.  Life had scarcely touched him, for he had very studiously guarded himself against any exposure; he had made himself invulnerable, physically as well as psychologically.  Psychologically he had refused to see himself as he was, and he could well afford to do this; but it was beginning to tell on him.  When he was not watchful, there was about him a deep haunted look.  Financially he was safe, at least as long as the present Government lasted and there was no revolution.  He also wanted a safe investment in the so-called spiritual world, and that was why he played with ideas, mistaking ideas for something spiritual, real.  He had no love except for his many possessions; he clung to them as a child clings to its mother, for he had nothing else.  It was slowly dawning on him that he was a very sad man.  Even this realization he was avoiding as long as he could; but life was pressing him.

When a problem is not consciously soluble, does the unconscious take over and help to solve it?  What is the conscious and what is the unconscious?  Is there a definite line where the one ends and the other begins?  Has the conscious a limit, beyond which it cannot go? Can it limit itself to its own boundaries?  Is the unconscious something apart from the conscious?  Are they dissimilar?  When one fails, does the other begin to function?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What is it that we call the conscious?  To understand what it is made up of, we must observe how we consciously approach a problem. Most of us try to seek an answer to the problem; we are concerned with the solution, and not with the problem.  We want a conclusion, we are looking for a way out of the problem; we want to avoid the problem through an answer, through a solution.  We do not observe the problem itself, but grope for a satisfactory answer.  Our whole conscious concern is with the finding of a solution, a satisfying conclusion.  Often we do find an answer that gratifies us, and then we think we have solved the problem.  What we have actually done is to cover over the problem with a conclusion, with a satisfactory answer; but under the weight of the conclusion, which has temporarily smothered it, the problem is still there.  The search for an answer is an evasion of the problem.  When there is no satisfactory answer, the conscious or upper mind stops looking; and then the so-called unconscious, the deeper mind, takes over and finds an answer.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The conscious mind is obviously seeking a way out of the problem, and the way out is a satisfying conclusion.  Is not the conscious mind itself made up of conclusions, whether positive or negative, and is it capable of seeking anything else?  Is not the upper mind a storehouse of conclusions which are the residue of experiences, the imprints of the past?  Surely, the conscious mind is made up of the past, it is founded on the past, for memory is a fabric of conclusions; and with these conclusions, the mind approaches a problem.  It is incapable of looking at the problem without the screen of its conclusions; it cannot study, be silently aware of the problem itself.  It knows only conclusions, pleasant or unpleasant, and it can only add to itself further conclusions, further ideas, further fixations.  Any conclusion is a fixation, and the conscious mind inevitably seeks a conclusion.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When it cannot find a satisfactory conclusion, the conscious mind gives up the search, and thereby it becomes quiet; and into the quiet upper mind, the unconscious pops an answer.  Now, is the unconscious, the deeper mind, different in its make-up from the conscious mind? Is not the unconscious also made up of racial, group and social conclusions, memories?  Surely, the unconscious is also the result of the past, of time, only it is submerged and waiting; and when called upon it throws up its own hidden conclusions.  If they are satisfactory, the upper mind accepts them; and if they are not, it flounders about, hoping by some miracle to find an answer.  If it does not find an answer, it wearily puts up with the problem, which gradually corrodes the mind.  Disease and insanity follow.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The upper and the deeper mind are not dissimilar; they are both made up of conclusions, memories, they are both the outcome of the past.  They can supply an answer, a conclusion, but they are incapable of dissolving the problem.  The problem is dissolved only when both the upper and the deeper mind are silent, when they are not projecting positive or negative conclusions.  There is freedom from the problem only when the whole mind is utterly still, choicelessly aware of the problem; for only then the maker of the problem is not. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
