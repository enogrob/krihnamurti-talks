<FONT size=5 color=black><B>MADRAS 46TH GROUP DISCUSSION 19TH DECEMBER, 1947</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>In your search to understand the inner significance of falling in love, you came to the point when you knew that you were in love and that your mind was wandering backwards and forwards - to the past and to the future - seeking pleasure in thinking of the past actions when you met the object of your love, or of the future when you would next meet her.  At this stage, most of you want to get a result or condemn the sensuous pleasure which you get out of the memory of your company with your object of love.  You have to understand the truth of this.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All existence is sensory.  Pleasure and pain are also sensory.  If you exclude any pleasure you must exclude all.  If you exclude all, you will cease to live.  Therefore, you realise that in life there are three important inescapable principles, Love, Pleasure and Pain of which pleasure and pain are sensory.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We have to understand the significance of pleasure and pain.  We generally deny pain and pursue pleasure.  Our daily life is one continual pursuing and denying.  The 'I' is the result of this pursuing and denying, and it is therefore a contradiction.  That which is in contradiction, cannot understand Truth.  You, therefore, realise that you who are in contradiction, cannot understand the truth of these three principles. When you realise this, you are against a blank wall.  At this stage, what happens to your seeking pleasure in a memory of your object of love back to the past or forward to the future? </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
