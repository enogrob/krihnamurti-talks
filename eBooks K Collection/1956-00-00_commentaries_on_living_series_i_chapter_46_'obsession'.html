<FONT size=5 color=black><B>COMMENTARIES ON LIVING SERIES I CHAPTER 46 'OBSESSION'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>HE SAID HE was obsessed by stupid little things, and that these obsessions constantly changed.  He would worry over some imaginary physical defect, and within a few hours his worry would have fixed itself upon another incident or thought.  He seemed to live from one anxious obsession to another.  To overcome these obsessions, he continued, he would consult books, or talk over his problem with a friend, and he had also been to a psychologist; but somehow he had found no relief.  Even after a serious and absorbing meeting, these obsessions would immediately come on.  If he found the cause, would it put an end to them?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Does discovery of a cause bring freedom from the effect?  Will knowledge of the cause destroy the result?  We know the causes, both economic and psychological, of war, yet we encourage barbarity and self-destruction.  After all, our motive in searching for the cause is the desire to be rid of the effect.  This desire is another form of resistance or condemnation; and when there is condemnation, there is no understanding.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Then what is one to do?" he asked.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why is the mind dominated by these trivial and stupid obsessions? To ask "why" is not to search for the cause as something apart from yourself which you have to find; it is merely to uncover the ways of your own thinking.  So, why is the mind occupied in this manner?  Is it not because it is superficial, shallow, petty, and therefore concerned with its own attractions?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
`Yes," he replied, "that appears to be true; but not entirely, for I am a serious person."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Apart from these obsessions, what is your thought occupied with?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"With my profession," he said.  "I have a responsible position. The whole day and sometimes far into the night, my thoughts are taken up with my business.  I read occasionally, but most of my time is spent with my profession."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Do you like what you are doing? "Yes, but it is not completely satisfactory.  All my life I have been dissatisfied with what I am doing, but I cannot give up my present position for I have certain obligations - and besides, I am getting on in years.  What bothers me are these obsessions, and my increasing resentment towards my work as well as towards people.  I have not been kind; I feel increasing anxiety about the future, and I never seem to have any peace.  I do my work well, but..."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why are you struggling against what is?  The house in which I live may be noisy, dirty, the furniture may be hideous, and there may be an utter lack of beauty about the whole thing; but for various reasons I may have to live there, I cannot go away to another house. It is then not a question of acceptance, but of seeing the obvious fact.  If I do not see what is, I shall worry myself sick about that vase, about that chair or that picture; they will become my obsessions, and there will be resentment against people, against my work, and so on.  If I could leave the whole thing and start over again, it would be a different matter; but I cannot.  It is no good my rebelling against what is, the actual.  The recognition of what is does not lead to smug contentment and ease.  When I yield to what is, there is not only the understanding of it, but there also comes a certain quietness to the surface mind.  If the surface mind is not quiet, it indulges in obsessions, actual or imaginary; it gets caught up in some social reform or religious conclusion: the Master, the saviour, the ritual, and so on.  It is only when the surface mind is quiet that the hidden can reveal itself.  The hidden must be exposed; but this is not possible if the surface mind is burdened with obsessions, worries.  Since the surface mind is constantly in some kind of agitation, conflict is inevitable between the upper and the deeper levels of the mind; and as long as this conflict is not resolved, obsessions increase.  After all, obsessions are a means of escape from our conflict.  All escapes are similar, though it is obvious that some are socially more harmful.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When one is aware of the total process of obsession or of any other problem, only then is there freedom from the problem To be extensively aware, there must be no condemnation or justification of the problem; awareness must be choiceless.  To be so aware demands wide patience and sensitivity; it requires eagerness and sustained attention so that the whole process of thinking can be observed and understood. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
