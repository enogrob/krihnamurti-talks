<FONT size=5 color=black><B>MADRAS 6TH GROUP DISCUSSION 1ST NOVEMBER, 1947</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>A mind which is trained in a pattern, i.e., specially moulded, conditioned, controlled, either in a creed or in a formula or in an idea, can never know itself.  Any suppression or control whether right or wrong, is based on a pattern of behaviour;  the mind, being thus controlled, is not free.  The mind can discover itself only when it is free of control and when there is a certain spontaneity.  Discovery of truth liberates us; we then transform ourselves with joy, clarity and quickness. For example, to find the truth about the need for discipline or otherwise, we must investigate the matter.  Some say that if you do not discipline yourself, there will be confusion.  Is there not confusion even though you are disciplined?  When you have only directed your attention on a particular thing excluding everything else, you still continue to be confused all round.  Discipline means education in a certain pattern, i.e., training the mind positively or negatively to a desired pattern, in order to produce a certain result.  A disciplined mind is conditioned and therefore static, and a static mind cannot understand the living problem of life.  Similarly, practice cannot lead to understanding.  The implications of practice are to repeat over and over again, something like discipline.  You cannot concentrate your faculties through any method or through any practice.  When you practise, you become automatic and thoughtless;  an automatic habit cannot lead to awareness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Life's problems are dynamic and living;  therefore, to understand them, you must have a mind which is also dynamic and not disciplined. Again, Truth can only come to you, you cannot go to it.  It is only when you can go to it that you can discipline yourself to reach it;  you can only move from the known to the known and not to the unknown.  If the means is 'discipline', the end is bound to be 'disciplined'.  Therefore, discipline cannot lead you to freedom.  No effort or practice can lead you to understanding.  Similarly, freedom is not a gradual process. Understanding cannot be through any process or through gradation which means the employment of time.  Time can only produce time, not the timeless.  Discipline is mere time and so it cannot lead to the Unknown, the Timeless.  When conditioned by a discipline, the mind is insensitive to its problems. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
