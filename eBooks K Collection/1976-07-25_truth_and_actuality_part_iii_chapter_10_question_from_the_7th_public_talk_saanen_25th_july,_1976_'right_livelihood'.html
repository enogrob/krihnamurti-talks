<FONT size=5 color=black><B>TRUTH AND ACTUALITY PART III CHAPTER 10 QUESTION FROM THE 7TH PUBLIC TALK SAANEN 25TH JULY, 1976 'RIGHT LIVELIHOOD'</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>Questioner: Is a motive necessary in business?  What is the right motive in earning a livelihood?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Krishnamurti: What do you think is the right livelihood? - not what is the most convenient, not what is the most profitable, enjoyable, or gainful; but what is the right livelihood?  Now, how will you find out what is right?  The word "right" means correct, accurate.  It cannot be accurate if you do something for profit or pleasure.  This is a complex thing.  Everything that thought has put together is reality.  This tent has been put together by thought, it is a reality.  The tree has not been put together by thought, but it is a reality.  Illusions are reality - the illusions that one has, imagination, all that is reality.  And the action from those illusions is neurotic, which is also reality.  So when you ask this question, "What is the right livelihood", you must understand what reality is.  Reality is not truth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now what is correct action in this reality?  And how will you discover what is right in this reality? - discover for yourself, not be told.  So we have to find out what is the accurate, correct, right action, or right livelihood in the world of reality, and reality includes illusion.  Don't escape, don't move away, belief is an illusion, and the activities of belief are neurotic, nationalism and all the rest of it is another form of reality, but an illusion.  So taking all that as reality, what is the right action there?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Who is going to tell you?  Nobody, obviously.  But when you see reality without illusion, the very perception of that reality is your intelligence, isn't it?  in which there is no mixture of reality and illusion.  So when there is observation of reality, the reality of the tree, the reality of the tent, reality which thought has put together, including visions, illusions, when you see all that reality, the very perception of that is your intelligence - isn't it? So your intelligence says what you are going to do.  I wonder if you understand this?  Intelligence is to perceive what is and what is not - to perceive "what is" and see the reality of "what is", which means you don't have any psychological involvement, any psychological demands, which are all forms of illusion.  To see all that is intelligence; and that intelligence will operate wherever you are. Therefore that will tell you what to do.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then what is truth?  What is the link between reality and truth? The link is this intelligence.  Intelligence that sees the totality of reality and therefore doesn't carry it over to truth.  And the truth then operates on reality through intelligence. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
