<FONT size=5 color=black><B>KRISHNAMURTI'S JOURNAL FOREWORD</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>IN SEPTEMBER 1973 Krishnamurti suddenly started keeping a journal.  For nearly six weeks he made daily entries in a notebook. For the first month of that period he was staying at Brockwood Park, Hampshire, and for the rest of the time in Rome.  He resumed the journal eighteen months later while in California.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nearly every entry starts with a description of some natural scene which he knows intimately, yet in only three instances do these descriptions refer to the place in which he was actually staying. Thus, the first page of the first entry describes the grove in the park at Brockwood, but by the second page he is evidently in Switzerland in imagination.  It is not until he is staying in California in 1975 that he again gives a description of his actual surroundings.  For the rest, he is recalling places he has lived in, with a clarity that shows how vivid is his memory for natural scenery, arising from the acuteness of his observation.  This journal also reveals to what an extent his teaching is inspired by his closeness to nature.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Throughout, Krishnamurti refers to himself in the third person as "he", and incidentally he tells us something about himself which he has not done before.
