<FONT size=5 color=black><B>THE ONLY REVOLUTION EUROPE PART 5</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>Meditation is the ending of the word.  Silence is not induced by a word, the word being thought.  The action out of silence is entirely different from the action born of the word; medita- tion is the freeing of the mind from all symbols, images and remembrances.

That morning the tall poplars with their fresh, new leaves were playing in the breeze.  It was a spring morning and the hills were covered with flowering almonds, cherries and apples.  The whole earth was tremendously alive.  The cypresses were stately and aloof, but the flowering trees were touching, branch to branch, and rows of poplars were casting swaying shadows.  Beside the road there was running water which would eventually become the old river.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There was scent in the air, and every hill was different from the others.  On some of them stood houses surrounded by olives and rows of cypresses leading to the house.  The road wound through all these soft hills.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was a sparkling morning, full of intense beauty, and the powerful car was somehow not out of place.  There seemed to be extraordinary order, but, of course, inside each house there was disorder - man plotting against man, children crying or laughing; the whole chain of misery was stretching unseen from house to house. Spring, autumn and winter never broke this chain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But that morning there was a rebirth.  Those tender leaves never knew the winter nor the coming autumn; they were vulnerable and therefore innocent.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From the window one could see the old dome of the striped marble cathedral and the many-coloured campanile; and within were the dark symbols of sorrow and hope.  It was really a lovely morning, but strangely there were few birds, for here people kill them for sport, and their song was very still.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He was an artist, a painter.  He said he had a talent for it as another might have a talent for the building of bridges. He had long hair, delicate hands and was enclosed within the dream of his own gifts.  He would come out of it - talk, explain - and then go back into his own den.  He said his pictures were selling and he had had several one-man exhibitions.  He was rather proud of this, and his voice told of it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is the army, within its own walls of self-interest; and the businessman enclosed within steel and glass; and the housewife pottering about the house waiting for her husband and her children. There is the museum-keeper, and the orchestra conductor, each living within a fragment of life, each fragment becoming extraordinarily important, unrelated, in contradiction to other fragments, having its own honours, its own social dignity, its own prophets.  The religious fragment is unrelated to the factory, and the factory to the artist; the general is unrelated to the soldiers, as the priest is to the layman.  Society is made up of these fragments, and the do-gooder and the reformer are trying to patch up the broken pieces.  But through these separative, broken, specialized parts, the human being carries on with his anxieties, guilt and apprehensions.  In that we are all related, not in our specialized fields.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the common greed, hate and aggression, human beings are related and this violence builds the culture, the society, in which we live.  It is the mind and the heart that divide - God and hate, love and violence - and in this duality the whole culture of man expands and contracts.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The unity of man does not lie in any of the structures which the human mind has invented.  Co-operation is not the nature of the intellect.  Between love and hate there can be no unity, and yet it is what the mind is trying to find and establish.  Unity lies totally outside this field, and thought cannot reach it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thought has constructed this culture of aggression, com- petition and war, and yet this very thought is groping after order and peace.  But thought will never find order and peace, do what it will.  Thought must be silent for love to be. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
