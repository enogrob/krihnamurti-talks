<FONT size=5 color=black><B>KRISHNAMURTI'S JOURNAL OJAI 44TH ENTRY 17TH APRIL 1975</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>Space is order.  Space is time, length, width and volume.  This morning the sea and the heavens are immense; the horizon where those yellow flowered hills meet the distant sea is the order of earth and heaven; it is cosmic.  That cypress, tall, dark, alone, has the order of beauty and the distant house on that wooded hill follows the movement of the mountains that tower over the low-lying hills; the green field with a single cow is beyond time.  And the man coming up the hill is held within the narrow space of his problems.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is a space of nothingness whose volume is not bound by time, the measure of thought.  This space the mind cannot enter; it can only observe.  In this observation there is no experiencer.  This observer has no history, no association, no myth, and so the observer is that which is.  Knowledge is extensive but it has no space, for by its very weight and volume it perverts and smothers that space. There is no knowledge of the self, higher or lower; there's only a verbal structure of the self, a skeleton, covered over by thought. Thought cannot penetrate its own structure; what it has put together thought cannot deny and when it does deny, it is the refusal of further gain.  When the time of the self is not, the space that has no measure is.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This measure is the movement of reward and punishment, gain or loss, the activity of comparison and conformity, of respectability and the denial of it.  This movement is time, the future with its hope and the attachment which is the past.  This complete network is the very structure of the self and its union with the supreme being or the ultimate principle is still within its own field.  All this is the activity of thought.  Thought can in no way penetrate that space of no time, do what it will.  The very method, the curriculum, the practice that thought has invented are not the keys that will open the door, for there is no door, no key.  Thought can only be aware of its own endless activity, its own capacity to corrupt, its own deceits and illusions.  It is the observer and the observed.  Its gods are its own projections and the worship of them is the worship of yourself.  What lies beyond thought, beyond the known, may not be imagined or made a myth of or made a secret for the few.  It is there for you to see. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
