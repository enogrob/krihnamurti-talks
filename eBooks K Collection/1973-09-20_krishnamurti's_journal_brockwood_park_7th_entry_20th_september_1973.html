<FONT size=5 color=black><B>KRISHNAMURTI'S JOURNAL BROCKWOOD PARK 7TH ENTRY 20TH SEPTEMBER 1973</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>The river was particularly beautiful this morning; the sun was just coming over the trees and the village hidden among them.  The air was very still and there was not a ripple on the water.  It would get quite warm during the day but now it was rather cool and a solitary monkey was sitting in the sun.  It was always there by itself, big and heavy.  During the day it disappeared and turned up early in the morning on the top of the tamarind tree: when it got warm the tree seemed to swallow it.  The golden green flycatchers were sitting on the parapet with the doves, and the vultures were still on the top branches of another tamarind.  There was immense quietness and one sat on a bench, lost to the world.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Coming back from the airport on a shaded road with the parrots, green and red, screeching around the trees, one saw across the road what appeared to be a large bundle.  As the car came near, the bundle turned out to be a man lying across the road, almost naked.  The car stopped and we got out.  His body was large and his head very small; he was staring through the leaves at the astonishingly blue sky.  We looked up too to see what he was staring at and the sky from the road was really blue and the leaves were really green.  He was malformed and they said he was one of the village idiots.  He never moved and the car had to be driven round him very carefully.  The camels with their load and the shouting children passed him without paying the least attention.  A dog passed, making a wide circle.  The parrots were busy with their noise.  The dry fields, the villagers, the trees, the yellow flowers were occupied with their own existence. That part of the world was underdeveloped and there was no one or organization to look after such people.  There were open gutters, filth and crowding humanity and the sacred river went on its way. The sadness of life was everywhere and in the blue sky, high in the air, were the heavy-winged vultures, circling without moving their wings, circling by the hour, waiting and watching. What is sanity and insanity?  Who is sane and who is insane?  Are the politicians sane?  The priests, are they insane?  Those who are committed to ideologies, are they sane?  We are controlled, shaped, pushed around by them, and are we sane?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What is sanity?  To be whole, non-fragmented in action, in life, in every kind of relationship that is the very essence of sanity. Sanity means to be whole, healthy and holy.  To be insane, neurotic, psychotic, unbalanced, schizophrenic, whatever name you might give to it, is to be fragmented, broken up in action and in the movement of relationship which is existence.  To breed antagonism and division, which is the trade of the politicians who represent you, is to cultivate and sustain insanity, whether they are dictators or those in power in the name of peace or some form of ideology.  And the priest: look at the world of priesthood.  He stands between you and what he and you consider truth, saviour, god, heaven, hell.  He is the interpreter, the representative; he holds the keys to heaven; he has conditioned man through belief, dogma and ritual; he is the real propagandist.  He has conditioned you because you want comfort, security, and you dread tomorrow.  The artists, the intellectuals, the scientists, admired and flattered so much are they sane?  Or do they live in two different worlds - the world of ideas and imagination with its compulsive expression, wholly separate from their daily life of sorrow and pleasure?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The world about you is fragmented and so are you and its expression is conflict, confusion and misery: you are the world and the world is you.  Sanity is to live a life of action without conflict.  Action and idea are contradictory.  Seeing is the doing and not ideation first and action according to the conclusion.  This breeds conflict.  The analyser himself is the analysed.  When the analyser separates himself as something different from the analysed, he begets conflict, and conflict is the area of the unbalanced.  The observer is the observed and therein lies sanity, the whole, and with the holy is love. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
