<FONT size=5 color=black><B>KRISHNAMURTI TO HIMSELF OJAI CALIFORNIA FRIDAY 11TH MARCH, 1983 (CONTINUED)</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>IT WAS REALLY a most lovely clear beautiful morning.  There was dew on every leaf.  And as the sun rose slowly, quietly spreading over the beautiful land, there was great peace in this valley.  The trees were full of oranges, small ones but many.  Gradually the sun lit every tree and every orange.  When you sat on that veranda overlooking the valley, there were the long shadows of the morning. The shadow is as beautiful as the tree.  We wanted to go out, not in a car, but out among the trees, smell the fresh air and the scent of many oranges and the flowers, and hear the sound of the earth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Later on one climbed right to the very top of the hill, overlooking the wide valley.  The earth doesn't belong to anyone.  It is the land upon which all of us are to live for many years, ploughing, reaping and destroying.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You are always a guest on this earth and have the austerity of a guest.  Austerity is far deeper than owning only a few things.  The very word austerity has been spoilt by the monks, by the sannyasis, by the hermits.  Sitting on that high hill alone in the solitude of many things, many rocks and little animals and ants, that word had no meaning.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Over the hills in the far distance was the wide, shining, sparkling sea.  We have broken up the earth as yours and mine - your nation, my nation, your flag and his flag, this particular religion and the religion of the distant man.  The world, the earth, is divided, broken up.  And for it we fight and wrangle, and the politicians exult in their power to maintain this division, never looking at the world as a whole.  They haven't got the global mind. They never feel nor ever perceive the immense possibility of having no nationality, no division, they can never perceive the ugliness of their power, their position and their sense of importance.  They are like you or another, only they occupy the seat of power with their petty little desires and ambitions, and so maintain apparently, as long as man has been on this earth, the tribal attitude towards life.  They don't have a mind that is not committed to any issue, to any ideals, ideologies - a mind that steps beyond the division of race, culture, that the religions man has invented.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Governments must exist as long as man is not a light to himself, as long as he does not live his daily life with order, care, diligently working, watching, learning.  He would rather be told what to do.  He has been told what to do by the ancients, by the priests, by the gurus, and he accepts their orders, their peculiar destructive disciplines as though they were gods on this earth, as though they knew all the implications of this extraordinarily complex life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sitting there, high above all the trees, on a rock that has its own sound like every living thing on this earth, and watching the blue sky, clear, spotless, one wonders how long it will take for man to learn to live on this earth without wrangles, rows, wars and conflict.  Man has created the conflict by his division of the earth, linguistically, culturally, superficially.  One wonders how long man, who has evolved through so many centuries of pain and grief, anxiety and pleasure, fear and conflict, will take to live a different way of life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As you sat quietly without movement, a bob cat, a lynx, came down.  As the wind was blowing up the valley it was not aware of the smell of that human being.  It was purring, rubbing itself against a rock, its small tail up, and enjoying the marvel of the earth.  Then it disappeared down the hill among the bushes.  It was protecting its lair, its cave or its sleeping place.  It was protecting what it needs, protecting its own kittens, and watching for danger.  It was afraid of man more than anything else, man who believes in god, man who prays, the man of wealth with his gun, with his casual killing. You could almost smell that bob cat as it passed by you.  You were so motionless, so utterly still that it never even looked at you; you were part of that rock, part of the environment.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why, one wonders, does man not realize that one can live peacefully, without wars, without violence; how long will it take him, how many centuries upon centuries to realize this?  From the past centuries of a thousand yesterdays, he has not learned.  What he is now will be his future.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was getting too hot on that rock.  You could feel the gathering heat through your trousers so you got up and went down and followed the lynx which had long since disappeared.  There were other creatures: the gopher, the king snake, and a rattler (rattle-snake). They were silently going about their business.  The morning air disappeared; gradually the sun was in the west.  It would take an hour or two before it set behind those hills with the marvellous shape of the rock and the evening colours of blue and red and yellow. Then the night would begin, the night sounds would fill the air; only late in the night would there be utter silence.  The roots of heaven are of great emptiness, for in emptiness there is energy, incalculable, vast and profound. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
