<FONT size=5 color=black><B>KRISHNAMURTI TO HIMSELF OJAI CALIFORNIA TUESDAY 27TH MARCH 1984</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>ON THAT DRIVE from the airport through the vulgarity of large towns spreading out for many, many miles, with glaring lights and so much noise, then taking the freeway and going through a small tunnel, you suddenly came upon the Pacific.  It was a clear day without a breath of wind but as it was early morning there was a freshness before the pollution of the monoxide gas filled the air.  The sea was so calm, almost like an immense lake.  And the sun was just coming over the hill, and the deep waters of the Pacific were the colour of the Nile, but at the edges they were light blue, gently lapping the shores.  And there were many birds and you saw in the distance a whale.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Following the coast road, there were very few cars that morning, but houses everywhere; probably very rich people lived there.  And you saw the pleasant hills on the left when you arrived at the Pacific.  There were houses right up among the hills and the road wound in and out, following the sea, and again came upon another town, but fortunately the highway didn't go through it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There was a naval centre there with its modern means of killing humanity.  And you went along and turned to the right, leaving the sea behind, and after the oil wells, you drove further away from the sea, through orange groves, past a golf course, to a small village, the road winding through orange orchards, and the air was filled with the perfume of orange blossom.  And all the leaves of the trees were shining.  There seemed to be such peace in this valley, so quiet, away from all crowds and noise and vulgarity.  This country is beautiful, so vast - with deserts, snowcapped mountains, villages, great towns and still greater rivers. The land is marvellously beautiful, vast, all inclusive.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And we came to this house which was still more quiet and beautiful, recently built and with the cleanliness that houses in towns don't have.  There were lots of flowers, roses and so on.  A place in which to be quiet, not just vegetate, but to be really deeply, inwardly, quiet.  Silence is a great benediction, it cleanses the brain, gives vitality to it, and this silence builds up great energy, not the energy of thought or the energy of machines but that unpolluted energy, untouched by thought.  It is the energy that has incalculable capacity, skills.  And this is a place where the brain, being very active, can be silent.  That very intense activity of the brain has the quality and the depth and the beauty of silence.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Though one has repeated this often, education is the cultivation of the whole brain, not one part of it; it is a holistic cultivation of the human being.  A High school or Secondary school should teach both science and religion.  Science really means the cultivation of knowledge, doesn't it?  Science is what has brought about the present state of tension in the world for it has put together through knowledge the most destructive instrument that man has ever found. It can wipe out whole cities at one blow, millions can be destroyed in a second.  A million human beings can be vaporized.  And science has also given us a great many beneficial things - communication, medicine, surgery and innumerable small things for the comfort of man, for an easy way of life in which human beings need not struggle endlessly to gather food, cook and so on.  And it has given us the modern deity, the computer.  One can enumerate the many, many things that science has brought about to help man and also to destroy man, destroy the entire world of humanity and the vast beauty of nature.  Governments are using the scientists, and scientists like to be used by governments for then they have a position, money, recognition and so on.  Human beings also look to science to bring about peace in the world, but it has failed, just as politics and the politicians have failed to give them total security, peace to live and cultivate not only the fields but their brain, their heart, their way of living, which is the highest art.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And religions - the accepted, traditional, superficial religions, creeds and dogmas - have brought about great damage in the world. They have been responsible for wars in history dividing man against man - one whole continent with very strong beliefs, rituals, dogmas against another continent which does not believe the same things, does not have the same symbols, the same rituals.  This is not religion, it is just repetition of a tradition, of endless rituals that have lost meaning except that they give some kind of stimulus; it has become a vast entertainment.  Religion is something entirely different.  We have often spoken about religion.  The essence of religion is freedom, not to do what you like, that is too childish, too immature and too contradictory, bringing great conflict, misery and confusion.  Freedom again is something entirely different. Freedom means to have no conflict, psychologically, inwardly.  And with freedom the brain becomes holistic, not fragmented in itself. Freedom also means love, compassion, and there is no freedom if there is not intelligence.  Intelligence is inherent in compassion and love.  We can go into this endlessly, not verbally or intellectually, but inwardly live a life of such a nature.  And in a Secondary school or a High school, science is knowledge.  Knowledge can expand endlessly, but that knowledge is always limited because knowledge is based on experience and that experience may be a theoretical, hypothetical result.  Knowledge is necessary but as long as science is the activity of a separate group, or a separate nation, which is tribal activity, such knowledge can only bring about greater conflict, greater havoc in the world, which is what is happening now. Science with its knowledge is not for destroying human beings because scientists after all are human beings first, not just specialists; they are ambitious, greedy seeking their own personal security like all the other human beings in the world.  They are like you and another.  But their specialization is bringing great destruction as well as some benefit.  The last two great wars have shown this.  Humanity seems to be in a perpetual movement of destruction and building up again - destroy and build; destroy human beings and give birth to a greater population.  But if all the scientists in the world put their tools down and said, `We will not contribute to war, to destroying humanity', they could turn their attention, their skill, their commitment to bringing about a better relationship between nature, environment and human beings.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If there is some peace among a few people, then those few, not necessarily the elite, will employ all their skill to bring about a different world, then religion and science can go together.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Religion is a form of science.  That is, to know and to go beyond all knowledge, to comprehend the nature and immensity of the universe, not through a telescope, but the immensity of the mind and the heart.  And this immensity has nothing whatsoever to do with any organized religion.  How easily man becomes a tool of his own belief, his own fanaticism, committed to some kind of dogma which has no reality.  No temple, no mosque, no church, holds truth.  They are symbols perhaps but symbols are not the actual.  In worshipping a symbol you will lose the real, the truth.  But unfortunately the symbol has been given far greater importance than truth.  One worships the symbol.  All religions are based on some conclusions and beliefs, and all beliefs are divisive, whether political beliefs or religious.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where there is division there must be conflict.  And a High school is not a place for conflict.  It is a place for learning the art of living.  This art is the greatest, it surpasses all other arts for this art touches the entire human being, not one part of him, however pleasant that may be.  And in a school of this kind, if the educator is committed to this, not as an ideal, but as an actuality of daily life - committed, let's repeat again, not to some ideal, some Utopia, some noble conclusion, he can actually try to find out in the human brain a way of living that is not caught in problems, strife, conflict and pain.  Love is not a movement of pain, anxiety, loneliness; it is timeless.  And the educator, if he would stick at it, could instil in the students' acquisition of knowledge this true religious spirit which goes far beyond all knowledge, which is perhaps the very end of knowledge - not perhaps - it is the end of knowledge.  For there must be freedom from knowledge to understand that which is eternal, which is timeless.  Knowledge is of time, and religion is free from the bondage of time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It seems so urgent and important that we bring about a new generation, even half a dozen people in the world would make a vast difference.  But the educator needs education.  It is the greatest vocation in the world. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
