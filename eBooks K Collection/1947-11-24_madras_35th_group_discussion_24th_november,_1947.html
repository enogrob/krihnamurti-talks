<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The educator is himself confused and therefore the person taught by him would also be confused.  The end always blinds us to the means and it would therefore be necessary to understand first the means adopted for the spread of Education.  Understanding of Education is possible only through its results and the means adopted.  An analysis was made of the present-day trends in Education and it was stressed that it is no use teaching anyone when the educator does not himself know the end-purpose of life. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
