<FONT size=5 color=black><B>MEDITATIONS 1969 PART 10</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>Happiness and pleasure you can buy in any market at a price.  But bliss you cannot buy for yourself or for another.  Happiness and pleasure are time-binding.  Only in total freedom does bliss exist. Pleasure, like happiness, you can seek, and find, in many ways.  But they come, and go.  Bliss that strange sense of joy has no motive.  You cannot possibly seek it.  Once it is there, depending on the quality of your mind, it remains timeless, causeless, and a thing that is not measurable by time.  Meditation is not the pursuit of pleasure and the search for happiness. Meditation, on the contrary, is a state of mind in which there is no concept or formula, and therefore total freedom.  It is only to such a mind that this bliss comes unsought and uninvited.  Once it is there, though you may live in the world with all its noise, pleasure and brutality, they will not touch that mind.  Once it is there, conflict has ceased.  But the ending of conflict is not necessarily the total freedom.  Meditation is a movement of the mind in this freedom.  In this explosion of bliss the eyes are made innocent, and love is then benediction. </DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
