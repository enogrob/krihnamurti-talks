<FONT size=5 color=black><B>FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT PUBLISHER'S NOTE</B></FONT><br><br><br><DIV class='PP2'>J. Krishnamurti is well known throughout the world as a unique thinker and teacher.  Many of his public talks and discussions as well as his personal writings have been published from time to time during the past sixty years; but a great number of these earlier publications have been out of print for years.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The K. & R. Foundation, a California corporation, has as one of its purposes the republication, as originally published, of certain of the works of J. Krishnamurti.  These will be contained in The Collected Works of Krishnamurti, of which this is the first volume.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In all his writings, Krishnamurti touches on the fundamental truth at the core of all religions, but he gives it a new expression understandable in our time.  His expression of this unique realization has naturally varied in the course of the years.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There was a time in the very beginning when Krishnamurti expressed himself through poetry and in parables.  These poetic writings represent a facet of Krishnamurti that is characterized by the intensity of his feelings and by his passionate appeal to the individual for self-realization of truth, each in his own unique, inimitable way.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In this first volume of his poetry Krishnamurti uses a multitude of similes in describing his feelings that reflect everywhere the beauty and the wonder of nature.  The effect of these descriptions is one of immense tenderness and great strength, of love of God and mankind, of acceptance and surrender at the same time.  The language of Krishnamurti is that of a seer and a poet - inevitably it touches profoundly the human heart.
